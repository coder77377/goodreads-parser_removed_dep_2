I'm no expert though. I've read about 25 of his books, but that's only about a 3rd of what he's written.<br/><br/>At first I found myself wondering if I had the author right. I kept waiting for horrible things to happen: evil clowns, monsters, Randall Flagg. You know, a [a:Stephen King|3389|Stephen King|http://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p2/3389.jpg] book. There are carnies, but no evil clowns.<br/><br/>That's probably not fair on my part, he has written a variety of things over the years, and not all of it is horror. Still it's what he's best known for, and it can be a bit surprising when evil isn't lurking around every corner. <br/><br/>That isn't to say this book doesn't have some spookiness and a sense of the fantastical going on. <br/><br/>Joyland is about a 21 year old college student named Devin Jones, recently ditched by his girlfriend who takes a summer job working at an amusement park in North Carolina called Joyland in the 1970s.<br/><br/>One of Joyland's biggest attractions is the Horror House, said to be haunted by the ghost of a girl who was murdered during the ride a few years past. That sounds more like the [a:Stephen King|3389|Stephen King|http://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p2/3389.jpg] we all know, right?<br/><br/>During his job interview, he meets the resident ""physic"" who gives him a prediction about his future. He's skeptical, because surely, it's all just an act for the show, right?<br/><br/>What follows is a time that Devin will never forget, and a story I greatly enjoyed. It's actually quite heart warming in places. It's really a book about people more than anything.<br/><br/>It's certainly not one of his scariest books, but it's one of the best of his I've read.

So what that boils down to is this book is somewhere in the middle of the pack for me. I never liked the original trilogy quite as much as some of my friends seemed to.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with this book was just how long it's been since I've read most of those books, especially the original trilogy. This book could really have done with some recap. I guess it doesn't have one since you could probably read this book without having read any of the previous books, but I'm not sure why you'd really want to.<br/><br/>I'm still not quite sure why but Glotka remains one of my favorite characters. He's a terrible person, but he's almost always the smartest one in the room, so I enjoy him outsmarting others I guess. It was good to see him again, even if he's only a minor character and the focus is on his daughter Savine and others of her generation. <br/><br/>She's not the only new character from the original books that is the offspring on a notable character. However most of them come as a bit of a surprise, so I'll just leave them for you to discover if you decide to read this. I thought most of the new characters were interesting in their own rights, and not remarkable for simply being someone's child. <br/><br/>In addition to aging up most of the characters you know to have adult children, technology has advanced too. This setting has a very much industrial revolution feel, with all the benefits and issues that came along with it.<br/><br/>Once I got back into the swing of things I found myself swept up in the story and all the new characters. I still don't have much of an interest in reading darker fantasy, but I do have an interest in seeing how the rest of this series turns out. I'll definitely be picking up the next one when it comes out.",,,1,,,1,2019/09/10,Audible,Like new,,

I've made lifelong friends and had unforgettable experiences that no other game before or since has matched. It's also coincided with my professional career as a software developer as I graduated from college the year wow was released.<br/><br/>Once upon a time I had aspirations to be a game developer, but somewhere along the way I decided I wanted to play games more than I wanted to write them. This book shows I made the right choice. I've spent far more hours playing World of Warcraft than I'd like to think about, but I don't know that I'd have wanted to put in the countless hours it took Blizzard to make.<br/><br/>This book combines two things I love in one package. When the kickstarter was announced I backed it immediately. Blizzard has been notoriously closed lipped about everything, especially the development of their games. I was a bit shocked to hear they not only approved of the book but also contributed various images.<br/><br/>It was fascinating to me to learn about early features that got cut, design decisions that were made and the marvel the game ever got released in the first place. For someone like me this was a perfect blend of storytelling and technology.<br/><br/>I don't think it's so technical that your average World of Warcraft fan wouldn't be able to follow it. I don't know if they will have the same enjoyment I did however. I found myself reading longer than I planned every time I picked it up. For that reason I gave it 5 stars.<br/><br/>I'd love to see similar books about the time and development of the game since it's launch, in particular the lessons learned and hardware and software details they applied to fix all the scaling and uptime issues they had in the early years of the game.<br/><br/>If you're interested in a peek behind the curtain of Blizzard, or World of Warcraft in particular this book is worth checking out.",,,1,,,1,2018/08/31,Kickstarter,Like new,,

There was also far less Darth Vader in this book than the cover seemed to imply.<br/><br/><b>Audiobook:</b> Another fantastic job as always by Marc Thompson. I don't read a lot of Star Wars books, but I'm always more inclined to listen to the ones he narrates. I don't like music/sound effects in audio books typically because I find they make it harder to focus on the story/hear the narration in most.<br/><br/>These books however do a great job with it making it at times feel more like a radio drama than an audiobook. I will say that his voice for Padme sounds a lot like his voice for Leia, but given the fact that he's a male and Leia's parentage I was OK with this. All of his other voices sound exactly like the characters from the movies/TV series to me.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>So I said in my summary that there is far less Darth Vader than I expected. That's because there is a lot more Anakin Skywalker. It turns out most of this novel is a flashback to the first time Thrawn encountered/interacted with the Republic/Empire. The stories are mostly told in parallel, but much of the story takes place in the past.<br/><br/>I didn't care much for Anakin after watching the movies, but the Clone Wars show really changed my opinion on the character. I thought they did a far better job there (and had a far better actor playing him). And while I think Natalie Portman does a good job as Padme in the movies the writing of her character is also much better on the show. Thankfully Mr. Zahn bases his portrayal of Padme on the show.<br/><br/>I've never been a huge Darth Vader fan. He's fine as an antagonist, and James Earl Jones has a fantastic voice but I just never found him that interesting. Thrawn on the other hand I think is probably the best antagonist the series has had, and I was glad to see him returned to cannon both on the page and in the Rebels TV show. I'd love to see him make his big screen debut at some point down the road.<br/><br/>The pairing of the two was interesting because their talents complement each other pretty well. Anakin tends to act before he thinks, while Thrawn is always planning things several moves in advance.<br/><br/>The story told here was entertaining enough but didn't do nearly as much to flush out Thrawn as the previous book did. There were a few little tidbits that have me intrigued, but as much of the book was a flashback we didn't get very much of the storyline from the previous book as I was hoping for. I think he's contracted to write a third book, so I'm hoping that book focuses more on those aspects.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an enjoyable book and if you're a casual Star Wars book reader like me this is one worth picking up, especially in audio.",,,1,,,1,2018/07/24,Audible,Like new,,

He's able to provide the details he wants to without it coming off like a giant infodump. And he does this while providing a variety of views on the matter without needing to do a lot of character development that would bog down such a short story.<br/><br/>I'll be curious to see how he handles this in the novel itself. Will he expect readers to have done this short story first, and leave those who haven't confused? Or will he rehash much of what is here? I hope he's done it in such a way that people who haven't read it won't be lost, but those of us who have will be rewarded with an enriched experience.

I'm not really sure how many Thrawn books this series is supposed to be, but this didn't really feel like an ending. Maybe that's because his story picks up in Star Wars Rebels, but I'm not sure this left off where that starts either.<br/><br/>Instead it both continues on the series and mostly feels like a stand alone story. We get more details on the Chiss Ascendancy, and get some background on well known Star Wars events.<br/><br/>Overall I found this an enjoyable story and I'd happily read another Thrawn book, but it adds little to the movies or TV.

Now I've gone back and binged on first his Broken Empire series and now this one.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this one far more. Both share really intriguing world building, but this one had far more likable characters and a much more intriguing plot. Oddly enough I found the second book the strongest of the three, but all of them were quite good.<br/><br/>I didn't like this series quite as much as Book of the Ancestor, but it cemented Mark Lawrence's new books as must read for me.

It's become a pretty trendy pick as of late, and <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword and Laser</a> chose it for the May pick this year.<br/><br/>While this is technically 5 connected stories, I think it reads much better as a novel. I think only the first story is satisfying by itself.<br/><br/>My original plan was to read the first 3 stories (a little under half the book) one weekend, then finish the book the next. Well Mr. Howey ruined those plans. When I got to the end of the third story I couldn't stop. Instead of reading 125 pages I read over 200, and put my original reading plans on hold so I could finish this first.<br/><br/>To me that's the ultimate sign of a great book. If you find yourself going out your way or re-arranging plans just to read.<br/><br/>The story mostly reads like a mystery novel, in a post-apocalyptic setting. People live in a large underground society. To the inhabitants, this is what life is like, and has always been like.<br/><br/>There is a screen on the top floor that shows ""outside"". The imagine slowly degrades over time as the camera gets dirty. To think of going outside is dangerous, to express that thought is a crime. <br/><br/>Many secrets lie beneath the surface, but discovering them can lead to your death. Through the series of five stories, we learn how things got the way they are.<br/><br/>I find it interesting that given recent events Mr. Howey is now considered by some to be sexist, when he's written one of the best female characters I've read in a long time. Personally I think the ""controversy"" has been overblown, and shouldn't deter anyone from checking this novel out.<br/><br/>The pace of the first three stories are pretty breakneck, but Mr. Howey does a great job of world building, especially in the second story. The pace slows down greatly in the final two books, especially the final one. I think the third story was my favorite part of the five.<br/><br/>Despite this the ending did feel a little rushed, and I'm certainly eager to continue on in the series. <br/><br/>The next set of stories is a prequel of sorts and helps to fill in some of the gaps I've been told, but what I really want to know is what happens next. Hopefully the next set of stories Mr. Howey is currently working on, will pick up where this one left off.",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

Eventually I got my bearings, but probably not as much as if I had reread.<br/><br/>This book has a lot of setup, and we get a bit of perspective from the preludes to each section. Thankfully like his earlier books all the chapters are from Vaelin's perspective.<br/><br/>Vaelin is older and wiser, but given where the series had previously left off, he's not quite the warrior he once was that earned him his infamy. Faced with a new threat, we get a bit of a different approach than in the past.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this book a lot, and there were parts of it where I was finding excuses to listen, but there were a few slower parts as well. <br/><br/>Either way I'm happy to report that my concerns were mostly assuaged.

I enjoyed his Frontline books even though I tend to prefer space opera to military sci-fi. After several books however I was kind of hoping for the series to wrap up. That still hasn't happen, but it seems that he took a break to write something new.<br/><br/>I think this is the best book he's written so far. It has a lot of the same elements that I liked about Frontlines, but seems to have a lot more depth to both the plot and the characters.<br/><br/>There is a lot more politics in this book, although the military element still plays a prevalent role. The book is set 5 years after a major war reminiscent of the world wars, but between planets instead of countries.<br/><br/>The first character we meet is a soldier on the wrong side of the war. It would be easy to hate him for what his planet did, but it's not that simple. Then there is the sergeant whose anger is understandable, but her prejudice is grating. However that's not all the defines her. I think I liked the young executive the best, but her life comes with a lot of baggage. It was refreshing to have a non-military POV.<br/><br/>The characters are all pretty interesting, but it's the larger mystery that really got me hooked. Unfortunately, we get very few details about what is going on. I was hoping for a bit more from this first entry than we got.<br/><br/>It's a bit on the short side, so I guess it's too be expected that we didn't get a ton of detail. What it did do was leave me eager to pick up the next book just as soon at it's out.",,,1,,,1,2019/07/19,Audible,Like new,,

My first reaction was who the hell is this guy, and why did they choose him over Jessica Williams or Samantha Bee?<br/><br/>He's really grown on me as he seems to have transitioned from simply filling in for Jon to finally making the show his own. I've had a few people recommend this book to me but I finally bought it when the audio was on sale recently.<br/><br/>The books jumps around a little bit at times but for the most part it chronologically covers the time from when Trevor was born until he started to make it big in both South Africa and the UK.<br/><br/>Trevor tells some unbelievable stories. I don't want to say more than that because I don't want to spoil them. Needless to say I would have never imagined that most of this had happened to him, and I'm amazed that he was able to rise above all the adversity he faced to get where he is today.<br/><br/>I think that's largely (if not entirely) due to his amazing mother. My first impressions of her were a little bit negative, but as the book progressed I came to find out what a truly remarkable person she is.<br/><br/>If you're interested in biographies or Trevor Noah himself, I highly recommend this one.

Now that I have, I'll be adding my voice to the praise of several of my friends here.<br/><br/>I prefer space-opera to hard sci-fi. I love character-driven stories. This book is both of those. In fact for much of the book there is very little overarching plot and mostly a lot of interconnected vignettes about a crew of a ship whose job it is to create wormholes between planets.<br/><br/>The crew is about 65% human and 35% alien. Oh, and one fantastic AI whose named after Ada Lovelace! There are a lot of alien species in this book, not just those aboard the Waybringer. Most of the focus of alien culture comes through the crew members, but we do get to learn a bit about some others as well.<br/><br/>Ms. Chambers does a great job of trying to come up interesting and alien seeming perspectives on the universe. <br/><br/>The pictures she paints may feel unrealistic to some. In a small ship of about 8 individuals there is very little conflict among them. In fact all of them get along well with each other save for 1 crewmate. Most of the conflict is external to the ship.<br/><br/>She also explores a variety of relationship ideas and what it means to love someone. That isn't to say this is a romance book. I personally am not a big fan of books with big romance arcs. Instead these ideas are often presented as just another part (albeit at times a large part) of the characters lives. I liked the way she weaved these ideas in.<br/><br/>Overall, I found it a nice change of pace. I read to escape realism, and I'd love to spend more time among the Wayfayer. Luckily for me being so late to the party, I don't have long to wait for book 2.

He does a good job with his inflections to make the various Bob's feel distinct from each other, and delivers the sarcasm particularly well.<br/> <br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>This book reminded me of a few different things that I'm a big fan. Bob himself reminds me a bit of Mark Watney from [b:The Martian|18007564|The Martian|Andy Weir|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1413706054s/18007564.jpg|21825181], a lot of the main plot line reminds me a bit of Star Trek, and finally some of the logistics remind me a lot of Resource Management/build systems in Real-Time Strategy games. There is also a touch of the Nerd Pop culture references that I loved so much from [b:Ready Player One|9969571|Ready Player One|Ernest Cline|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1489368740s/9969571.jpg|14863741], but far less abundant/integral to the story.<br/><br/>This blend of things I love, along with a protagonist (or should I say protagonists?) that have a background in Software Development/Engineering made this book work really well for me. It appears that Bob's background matches Mr. Taylor's (and my own) so I can see why I enjoyed it so much.<br/><br/>There are several main plotlines of this book, and I enjoyed them all, but I found ""original"" Bob's to be the slowest/least interesting for me. Riker's was probably the best part, but what I really wanted was more from Bill. When I was younger I wanted to be a proper engineer and not just a code monkey, and the idea of setting up a ""Skunkworks"" in space was by far the most appealing to me.<br/><br/>I love the space exploration stuff, but I guess I was just more interested into the fate of humanity rather than so of the discoveries being made by ""original"" Bob and some of the others. Riker's journey back to Sol and the subsequent events are what moved the plot along best.<br/><br/>I really like the way this book was written. The very short chapters that swap POVs frequently works really well, especially since technically they are all still Bob. I like a lot of the ideas Mr. Taylor plays with here. I'm always looking forward to seeing what the Bobs will come up with next.<br/><br/>My only minor complaints are that there are a fewer parts I found a bit slow, and the somewhat abrupt ending. I won't go so far as to call it a cliffhanger, but I am certainly glad I could jump immediately into the second book.<br/><br/>Overall, if you like some of the same influences that I do, or just the ideas of space exploration, artificial intelligence or just Space Opera, I highly recommend this.

This one is very different from most of the fantasy I've read.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>When I first started reading a lot of fantasy, it was almost exclusively Urban Fantasy. At some point I got burned out on it and almost stopped reading it entirely save for Dresden Files. It felt like every series was full of vampires, werewolves and crime-solving protagonists.<br/><br/>Jade city has none of that. That's a large part of what makes it so refreshing. This book seems to ask the question ""What if the Yakuza ran a nation due to the natural born ability to channel power from rare Jade gemstones?""<br/><br/>Enter the Green Bones. Not everyone can use Jade to make themselves faster and stronger, but those who can are not to be trifled with. Of course along with power comes rivalry and those who want to get some of that power for themselves. This sets up several different conflicts that make this book so enjoyable.<br/><br/>The book focuses three siblings and their adoptive cousin who belong to the Kaul family which runs one of the two major clans that rule over the fictitious island nation of Kekon. Each sibling is compelling in their own way, but for me Shae was my favorite. It was her story I was most interested in as the book unfolded.<br/><br/>In addition to the main four however, there is a great supporting cast of characters, including Wen. She starts off looking like the typical supporting female character, but that changes as the book unfolds. Her subplot is probably one of those I'm most interested in. I hope Ms. Lee develops her character further in the next book.<br/><br/>I love me a good magic system, and tend to be put off by books with too much handy waving magic or stuff that is derivative. While we don't get a real good feel for how/what the jade does, it's enough to be interesting and not feel like it was simply a plot device. <br/><br/>I particularly like the genetic aspect of the magic. Only some people can use Jade. For nearly all others it makes them sick/kills them simply to handle it. That is except the Stone Eyes. And of course those who can't use Jade are determined to find a way around their genetics. This makes for some great fight scenes, a lot of intriguing drama and world building.<br/><br/>I did find the book took a little while for it to get going. I was never bored, but I took awhile to warm up to some of the characters and for the main plot to kick off.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this to be one of the most refreshing reads in a long time, and more willing to give new Urban Fantasy books a look in the future. I'll definitely be picking up the next book in this series.",,,1,,,1,2018/01/23,Amazon,unspecified,,

I tend to prefer Space Opera, or Space Fantasy instead.

I must say I found it all very confusing. Not long into it, I decided to essentially just treat the science like fantasy and ignore most of the details. <br/><br/>In my mind, it came down to this:<br/><br/>1) Calendar Math somehow powers a variety of technology of the ruling empire<br/>2) It's critical to how their soldiers fight in battle<br/>3) It keeps the leaders powerful and in control<br/>4) Going against it is pretty much the worst thing you can do and is an act of war/punishable by death.<br/><br/>Beyond that, nothing really matters as far as I'm concerned.

This one however was right up my alley.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how much research she did, but it seems like a lot. The fiction part of this book is mostly setting up a reason to accelerate the US space program by about a decade and then continue to push it forward from that point in a way we never really did. It sort of posits: ""What would our space exploration look like if we made it the main focus and not just a Cold War arms race?"".<br/><br/>I really like Elma. I can relate a lot to her and her social anxiety. I love the way she counts numbers in her head when she's feeling anxious. Maybe I should give that a try.

It was important to the plot, but not the point of the plot if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed this book a lot and immediately jumped right into the second one.

Since it was short though, I wanted to listen to it sooner rather than later, write up my review then move onto something else.<br/><br/>Apparently I just needed to listen to this. Apart from one story (Way in the Middle of the Air) which made me really uncomfortable and showed it's age. It appears to have been eliminated from several of the more recent editions of this book, and I wish I had skipped it as it really adds very little to this collection.<br/><br/>Everything else was enjoyable. A bit depressing, but enjoyable. Mr. Bradbury paints a bleak picture of a future that thankfully never came. This isn't hard sci-fi by any means, but more like dystopian space opera.<br/><br/>I would have never thought something bleak would lighten my mood, but the stories were that good, and the prose are excellent. They reminded me a lot of the Twilight Zone, although I know these stories predate that show. I think The Silent Towns could easily have been an episode of the show, as could several others.<br/><br/>I think my favorite of the collection is Usher II. I can't pretend to get all the references apart from Poe and Lovecraft, but his tale of revenge for censorship is quite good. I'll have to check out the Poe story [b:The Fall of the House of Usher|175516|The Fall of the House of Usher|Edgar Allan Poe|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1387708966s/175516.jpg|15570703] that seems to have influenced it.<br/><br/>Overall this is an excellent collection of stories, and if like me you haven't read it/anything by Mr. Bradbury, this seems like as good a place as any to start.",,,1,,,1,,,Like new,,

It's been a few years since I last read it (likely as a re-read before book 7). It's a great book for re-reading. The characters are all well developed and the story pulls you in and holds on as you adventure along with Harry as he battles bullies at home, at school, and on the quidditch pitch before confronting the ultimate bully in Lord Voldemort. <br/><br/>This book introduces the reader to the world of magic and muggles. Of Hogwarts and broomsticks. It's not as good as several of the later books, but it's an excellent kick-off and signs of what is to come are quite apparent.",,,4,,,0,,,,,

Despite that I found them to be enjoyable. Like settling into something comfortable and familiar. In the ever increasing abundance of grimdark fantasy, this serves as a nice break.<br/><br/>Audio book: I listened to this in audio after getting a good deal on it through Audible. I was quickly sold on finishing the series in audiobook. <br/><br/>This is the first book I've listened to by Tim Gerald Reynolds. I found him to be an excellent reader. Not only is he clear and easy to understand, he seems to have a variety of voices that greatly increased my enjoyment of the book. <br/><br/><br/>Full Review<br/><br/><br/>Since this is an omnibus, I'm going to opt to review each story individually.<br/><br/><br/>The Crown Conspiracy<br/><br/><br/>The first story is a bit uneven. We meet thieves Royce Melborn and Hadrian Blackwater, who work under the name of Riyria. Royce is the prototype rogue while Hadrian the oft underestimated fighter. Mr. Sullivan does give them both a great amount of depth and had me greatly liking them by the end of the book.<br/><br/>During the course of the book, we meet a bumbling monk, an arrogant prince, a mysterious wizard, and a treacherous dwarf. The story is a bit lacking on female characters. The princess Arista is a bit interesting, but the focus isn't really on her. We also get the ""prostitute with a heart of gold"" who is just a minor character.<br/><br/>I found this story a bit uneven. There were some slow and predictable parts that seemed to just write themselves. However there was also some twists and turns that kept me guessing a little bit.<br/><br/>The pair take a job that leads them on an unexpected journey that turns them from thieves to reluctant heroes. There is a good mix of action that gets a bit dark, but nothing like you see in most grimdark these days. So if you're looking for another gritty ""realistic"" fantasy series, look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Overall this was a fun story and a good first effort from Mr. Sullivan. I probably liked it more than someone looking for something new and original might. It's the type of story I enjoy, especially taking a break from darker novels.<br/><br/>3.5 Stars.<br/><br/><br/>Avempartha<br/><br/><br/>This was the better of the two stories. There are a few slower parts early on, but once the story really got going, it was hard to stop listening.<br/><br/>We gets some insights into both Royce and Hadrian's past. There is some resolution to lingering story lines from the previous story, as well as a humorous nod to it.<br/><br/>We also get some insights into the mysterious wizard and the treacherous dwarf.<br/><br/>Princess Arista has a larger role in this book, although I find her a bit unlikable. Maybe that's simply due to her being raised a spoiled princess. I do think her heart is mostly in the right place even if she comes off like a spoiled brat in places.<br/><br/>The best addition to the cast was the farmer's daughter Thrace, who is the naive farmer's daughter with an abundance of courage. Again a bit tropey, but very likable and it's nice to have another female character at least.<br/><br/>The conspiracies introduced in the first story are explored further and <br/>we get some more insights on the larger scale.<br/><br/>Riyria has been sought out by Thrace at the prompting of an old acquaintance to help her father obtain a magical sword to defeat an evil beast that is plaguing her small village.<br/><br/>I'm most intrigued by the elves, who have always been my favorite fantasy element, who like many other books are elusive. We still don't meet any full-blooded elves, but we do get to experience some of their architecture. I hope we'll get to see something from them soon, maybe in the form of a strong female elf.<br/><br/>I thought this was a lot less predictable than the first story, and really enjoyed the character development of our two protagonists. There is some nice setup for the next books that has me eager to continue on in the series. Not only that, but Mr. Sullivan does a good job of developing many of his supporting characters as well.<br/><br/>This again isn't a story that will appeal to grimdark fans as it's more of a light fantasy where despite the dangers things work out for the best. Mostly.<br/><br/>4 stars.",,,2,,,1,2013/05/16,Audible,Like new,,

I've enjoyed just about every one of his books. He has a writing style that tends to meander at times, and is prone to tangents. I always seem to find this just as entertaining as the main plot. <br/><br/>This book didn't seem to have any major tangents, but it did follow his other typical pattern of telling multiple connected stories in one book.<br/><br/>This book is a loose sequel to [b:Reamde|10552338|Reamde|Neal Stephenson|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1305993115s/10552338.jpg|15458989] and shares characters and history with [b:Cryptonomicon|816|Cryptonomicon|Neal Stephenson|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327931476s/816.jpg|1166797]. If you haven't read those books, you can probably read this stand alone, but of the two Reamde would be the better one to have read as some the characters at the center of the plot for this book were also at the center of that.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Reamde and the start of this book as it feels much the same. However by the end of the book more time is spent inside the simulation and less out in the real world. Things feel far more like a fantasy book rather than sci-fi. Now I love a good fantasy story, and that makes up the majority of the books I read, but I found this one to be far less enjoyable than the sci-fi story that preceded it.<br/><br/>Overall I found this book good, but not great. I'll happily pick up his next book and more than likely enjoy it. If you've enjoyed most of his past works, you'll probably enjoy this. If you haven't ready any of his work, there are better books to start with.",,,1,,,1,2019/06/04,Audible,Like new,,

I'm sure I got a daily deal or I probably wouldn't have bothered. I used to love Urban Fantasy and read a ton of it, but after awhile I just got tired of it and pretty much everything new I've tried has felt derivative or uninteresting.<br/><br/>For the first half of this book I was ready to lump this book in with all those others. Not only did this pale in comparison to Dresden Files, the origin story felt like copy/paste. It can be hard to remember that [b:Storm Front|47212|Storm Front (The Dresden Files, #1)|Jim Butcher|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1419456275s/47212.jpg|1137060] is not the best written book.<br/><br/>However it was the first urban fantasy book I read, so I didn't know any better at the time. And now I'm so many books into the series that it's hard to separate my love for the series and characters from the quality of the writing and story.<br/><br/>So however unfair it may be the first book of a new Urban Fantasy series book, I'm always comparing it the entire Dresden Files series, not just [b:Storm Front|47212|Storm Front (The Dresden Files, #1)|Jim Butcher|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1419456275s/47212.jpg|1137060].<br/><br/>I think if I'm being completely fair this book is probably slightly better, even if I liked it much less. The second half finally started to differentiate itself from Dresden Files.<br/><br/>In particular, despite their near identical backgrounds Harry and Alex are quite different. Harry is a bruiser. He prefers to take the fight to the bad guys and solve his problems with fireballs and bullets.<br/><br/>Alex however is a planner. His magical ability to walk possible futures means he's all about being prepared and avoiding the worst of what might happen. It is for this reason that I found the book growing on me as it went along.<br/><br/>That said, it's still the first book in a series and that comes with some of the setup that comes for that. There thankfully seems enough here to differentiate itself from most other urban fantasy I've read. I'll probably pick up the audio for the next book whenever I'm in the mood for something lighter.",,,1,,,1,2017/06/22,Audible,Like new,,

I was really getting fed up with her character. For someone so smart, she tends to always find herself in trouble. I guess that's supposed to be due to being noble-born and therefore naive about the ways of the world.<br/><br/>I really thought I wasn't going to like this story, but things turned out differently.<br/><br/>Finally in this book, Arista becomes much more likable. Away from the comforts she was used to, instead of whining and complaining, she adapts. <br/><br/>This has easily been my favorite of the series thus far. Not only has Arista developed but we're introduced to another great character in Emelia. Once a simple kitchen worker, she finds herself suddenly in the middle of plotting and politics.<br/><br/>And of course Royce and Hadrian are back. We get some great insights into the backstory of both.<br/><br/>Mr. Sullivan seems to have a knack for writing good episodic stories that build on the overarching story. Things are wrapped up nicely while still leaving you wanting to continue on in the series.<br/><br/>4.5 Stars.<br/><br/><i><b>The Emerald Storm</b></i><br/><br/>This one started kind of slow, especially after how much I enjoyed the last one, but the second half was much better.<br/><br/>I could have done without the pity party and the ""I'm retired"" bit, because we all know Royce and Hadrian are going to instrumental to the rest of the series at this point.<br/><br/>So it turns out the Emerald Storm is a ship, but the story ended up taking a much different turn than I expected. I figured there was going be a lot more pirates and high sea action, but the real story was more about the crew of the ship itself.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the supporting cast in this book more than probably the previous three. There are a lot of shady characters, and some down right despicable ones that add a lot to story.<br/><br/>There is a lot more setup in this story than the rest, and the path to the finale seems clear now.<br/><br/>4 Stars.",,,2,,,0,,,,,

The last book was probably my favorite of the series so far because it focused so much on Rogues, which has always been my favorite type of character to roleplay.<br/><br/>This one focuses more on Paladins, which I generally dislike.

I guess I'm just a lot more Chaotic Good than Lawful Good.<br/><br/>The mystery tying the two main stories of the series continues to be interesting, but we learned very little new in this volume. I would have liked more with that regard. Things did get set up nicely for the next book, so maybe we'll finally get some more answers then.<br/><br/>Overall this continues to be a fun series, but I hope  he's going somewhere with it and not simply meandering around  on a neverending role playing campaign.

Go ahead, I'll wait. Trust me, it will be worth it.<br/><br/>Wow, you're a fast reader! See. I told you it would be worth it!<br/><br/>So anyways, I really love that series and I've been recommending it for years. When this series was announced I was a bit disappointed. It seems like the market appeal for ""young adult"" was too much to avoid. I worried this book would have all the trappings that leaves most YA books pretty unappealing to me.<br/><br/>Then again I liked his Shadow Campaign series so much that I picked up his Middle Grade series [b:The Forbidden Library|17987501|The Forbidden Library (The Forbidden Library, #1)|Django Wexler|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1372045701s/17987501.jpg|25223481] and ended up liking that quite a bit too, even though I'm not the target audience.<br/><br/>Early on I was struggling a bit with the book. I found Isoka to be unlikeable. This was by intent, but she felt like another cookie-cutter anti-hero. However my initial impressions were misplaced and do a disservice to Mr. Wexler's character development. Mr. Wexler has written Isoka to be complex. There are times when I like her, and times when I don't, but I came to understand her more as the book went on.<br/><br/>This was not the case with Meroe however. I loved her pretty much from the first time we meet her, and for me she's the real star of the show. Yeah Isoka is a badass Jedi-like fighter, but Meroe is a delight.<br/><br/>The world building for this book is also excellent. I love me a good magic system and this one intrigues me. I don't envy the job of fantasy writers trying to come up with something that doesn't seem too derivative and is still appealing to readers at the same time. I have a lot of questions about the nature of magic in this world, especially after some of the developments near the end of the book.<br/><br/>I will say this book is still YA for a reason, and I might have liked it a touch better if it weren't, but it probably starts out even stronger than [b:The Thousand Names|15810910|The Thousand Names (The Shadow Campaigns, #1)|Django Wexler|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355441268s/15810910.jpg|21536059] did, at least once the main plot gets going.<br/><br/>I'm eagerly looking forward to the next book and Mr. Wexler continues to be one of the best fantasy writers I enjoy that seems to still be under the radar to many mainstream fantasy readers. <br/><br/>Maybe this book will have the broader appeal that is lacking in [b:The Thousand Names|15810910|The Thousand Names (The Shadow Campaigns, #1)|Django Wexler|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355441268s/15810910.jpg|21536059] due to the heavy military action.

It's largely in part to Bruce Lee. Moreso than I realized before reading this book. By the time I was growing up those films were pretty prevalent, good, bad and everywhere in between.<br/><br/>I never realized what a pioneer Bruce was. I also didn't realize what a shitty husband he was. They say never meet your heroes, and for good reason. While I never met him, this book showed me that Bruce Lee wasn't quite the idol material he's often made out to be. He made some good movies, and was a great martial artist. But he like all of us were flawed.<br/><br/>He overcame a misspent youth to go on to inspire millions and died tragically young. I've probably watched his son Brandon's movie the Crow 10x more than I've watched Enter the Dragon, and it's a shame that tragedy has seemed to follow this family.<br/><br/>Overall if like me you loved Bruce Lee growing up, you may find this a pretty interesting read.

The main focus is a young boy named Arlen. However we get a fair bit of time with Leesha and later on Rojer.<br/><br/>Arlen's chapters were good, but probably the most predictable of the three.  I still found his journey to be fascinating as the world Mr. Brett has created is excellent.

We don't really know why they are coming, or if anything can be done to stop them, but the Warded Man seems determined to find a way.<br/><br/>Leesha's chapters were easily my favorite. I especially loved Bruna, the town herb gatherer. I thought Leesha got a lot of great character development, and I was most interested in seeing where her plot would go. I will say there was one part of her story I didn't care for, and largely felt unnecessary to the plot/her character development. Maybe I'm being unfair to Mr. Weeks, but I saw it coming a mile away and that didn't make it any less frustrating when it happened.<br/><br/>Rojer was the least interesting of the three to me, but by the end of the book he had grown into something far more interested than expected.

He's maybe a little too naive as a result, but I found it refreshing after how awful many of the other characters turned out to be.<br/><br/>I'm curious to see where this series goes, this book set things up nicely.

It includes a much larger look at the history of Pakistan, in particular the region where Malala grew up. It also includes important events during her lifetime that helped to shape the circumstances leading to her being shot.<br/><br/>I found the start of this book a bit on the slow side, but once I got into it, I found all the extra detail more interesting and informative. I know very little about Pakistan. This book helped to give me a lot more background on the country and its people.<br/><br/>I first heard about Malala, like many people I suspect after she had been shot. I had no idea about the struggle women are going through in that region just to get an education. It's incredible the courage and drive of Malala and her father to help to provide something that is often under appreciated here in the United States. A basic education.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how much of this book was written by Malala herself, and how much was done by Christina Lamb, but I thought they did a good job of balancing Malala's personal story with the larger story of her country to give the reader a lot more context and hopefully lead to a better understanding of why her efforts are so important.<br/><br/>If you're interested in learning more about the Middle East, the struggle for equality or just a fascinating story of someone willing to stand up against incredibly difficult circumstances, this book is a pretty good read.",,,1,,,1,2016/09/28,Audible,Like new,,

This book reminds me of that a bit, but with a more diverse cast of characters. Kaz Brekker is no Locke Lamora, but I really loved Inej and Nina, so that makes up for it.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Kaz is a well written character, he's just not that likeable. Much like the Gentleman Bastards, this book is made up of thieves and scoundrels. Unlike that series, this book mixes in romantic elements.<br/><br/>Anyone who reads my reviews knows that's not really my thing. I thought it fit in well with the story though, and wasn't the main focus. I'm always a bit leary of ""Young Adult"" for this reason, but in many ways I felt this book was far darker than the first book of Locke Lamora.<br/><br/>Apart from its interesting characters, this book also has some really great world building. Apparently this is a sequel series of sorts to the Ms. Bardugo's earlier trilogy with easter eggs back, but I'm guessing brand new characters? I suspect that's why her world feels so rich. She's had three prior books to explore it. I can't say for sure however as I haven't read them.<br/><br/>Ms. Bardugo's magic system seems pretty interesting and unique, and she immediately throws a wrench into how it works in the very first chapter.<br/><br/>I love a good heist story, and this book definitely delivers there.

Looking forward to get to book 3 soon.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I originally came onto this series after a recommendation in a thread about books similar to Firefly. Two books in, I'm hard to agree with that. Sure you have a crew flying around ship, but that's about where the similarities end for me.<br/><br/>For one thing, the characters are far less likable in this series than on Firefly. I recall coming to like them a more by the end of the first book, but whether it was the gap of time, or their general selfishness, I found myself disliking them again at the start of this book as well. You have no real closeness between any of the characters at the start. <br/><br/>They aren't really friends or comrades, so much as a bunch of people with no other place to go. At least sometimes. There has definitively been developments in both the characters and their relationships as the series has gone on.<br/><br/>Despite all of that, it was still a fun an enjoyable book. I'm not really into Steampunk, but this is fairly light on that. I'm almost more inclined to call this flintlocke fantasy much of the time. You do have airships and various mechanical based magic though. Whatever it's subgenre may be, I find the world building fascinating.<br/><br/>There is plenty of politics and mystery. First, you have the religious cult-like Awakeners and their determination to wipe out all Daemonists and anyone who opposes them. However their political clout seems to waning. <br/><br/>That is no help for the secretive Daemonists however, who must still hide their study of magic from all but a few if they wish to live. Then there are the mysterious Mane. They are considered to be violent and dangerous, but what are their true motivations? <br/><br/>Finally you have the typical mysterious pasts of the various crew members. All of this adds depth and flavor to the main story of salvaging a valuable treasure on a downed airship. The pace of the story is fast and the writing is excellent. <br/><br/>Somehow Mr. Wooding keeps his hooks in me despite writing characters I have trouble liking and caring for.

I snagged this because of a sale after enjoying the movie, because the book is almost always better than the movie. This however, was a rare case when it wasn't.<br/><br/>I suspect that won't be true for everyone. I like history, but it's not a subject I read about much. I tend to prefer documentaries or dramatizations instead. The story in this book, about an elaborate plan to build not one but three tunnels to escape a German camp during World War Two sounds so incredible that it just screams movie plot.<br/><br/>I found the early going with a lot of the background information rather dry and slow. I imagine history buffs will find that more interesting than I did. I tend to forget names just as soon as I learn them however. Once the meat of the plan got going, I found it quite a fascinating read.<br/><br/>It's by no means a long book. Running around 7.5 hours. The movie is nearly 3. For me personally, I think the movie did a better job in showing the best parts, and cutting out some of the less interesting ones. Your mileage may vary.

It's both funny and smart.<br/><br/>The characters are excellent too. You'll never look at Goblins the same way again. Mr. Hayes takes some well worn tropes of RPGs and comes at them from every angle, all while telling a pretty good story that will make you want to run out and pick up your dice. Or at least it did for me.<br/><br/>For you D&D sorts you may want to keep your copy of the player's handbook at hand, so you can look up various spells as you read. Or maybe that's just me. Perhaps you have them all memorized anyways.<br/><br/>The writing is a bit unpolished in some places, but I was too busy having fun to really care. Great characters, story telling and my general nostalgia of the years I spent playing Dungeons and Dragons really endeared this book to me immediately.<br/><br/>Mr. Hayes also sets things up nicely for a series. I'm not sure how many he has in mind, but I could read a whole bunch of them. I'm not playing D&D anymore, so this might be as close as I can get for now.<br/><br/>This book has far too few reviews on Goodreads. I highly recommend picking this up, at least if you're an RPG fan. I'll be curious to see if it's as enjoyable to general fantasy fans.

Some of the previous books were funny at times with memorable characters, but the story was slow or disjointed. I liked the investigation into the cult of idiots by a Captain who'd rather be drunk.

It's one of those rare occasions for me where I watched the TV show before reading the book. Apparently a lot of fans of the books don't like the show, but I enjoyed it. It motivated me to finally pick up the book.<br/><br/>As is usually the case, the book is better. It seems as though the show decided to cut down the first 2/3 of this book into a single episode. Likely because they didn't want to have to find/use a child lead for half the season. I think Ragnar's story suffers a bit as a result. I found that fascinating to read.<br/><br/>It also seems like they either added a bunch of stuff, or more likely used parts of book 2 at the end of the season. I wasn't really surprised by anything since I knew what was coming, but I still enjoyed it. I likely would have enjoyed it a bit more had I read the book first. I didn't realize until about halfway into the season that it was based on books I already owned/had on my to read shelf. Oops.<br/><br/>The writing is good, and the characters are interesting. I know almost nothing about English history, so it's hard to know what's truth and what Mr. Cornwell made up. It comes off very realistic to me though. <br/><br/>I've always enjoyed history, and I must really enjoy this time period, because I've read a boatload of fantasy based on it. This one feels a bit fantastical at times with the various gods and superstitions of both the Danes and the English.<br/><br/>Overall, I found it a fast and enjoyable read.

However since I love those books, I really wanted to check out some of their other writing.<br/><br/>I got this one on a daily deal earlier this year, and with the fourth book out this month, I decided to give it a go.<br/><br/>The setting for this is one where magic has almost passed from the world. The dragons that once ruled are gone. Leaving 13 races and many ruins in their wake, but little in the way of record or magic. Normally I prefer books with cool magic systems, but there is a lot to like here that I didn't mind their not being any mages throwing fireballs around.<br/><br/>Most of the book follows 4 POV characters, with a 5th used in the prologue and a 6th one added near the end. Of the main ones we have Gedar, Marcus, Cithrin and Dawson.<br/><br/>Gedar is a young and mostly foolish noble, whose ideas come from books rather than experience who is out on his first campaign. Marcus is a season veteran of much renown with a troubled past. Cithrin is a young ward of a bank, who is smart and capable despite her lack of experience of the larger world and Dawson is a powerful noble whose sense of honor only extends to those with the right blood.<br/><br/>They make for a good mix of characters, each having things I like and dislike about them. These aren't perfect characters by any means, and it's sometimes hard to know who to root for when their positions oppose one another.<br/><br/>This book is a lot more about politics and economics than it is about big battles or magic. Most SFF books tend to gloss over the economics most of all, even if they are focused on the politics. The two pretty much go hand in hand and often money is relegated to not having enough and taxes. This books focuses on banking and the roles the banks play in the politics of the nations. The banks are independent and only care about making a profit and not about who is at war with whom. <br/><br/>There are 1 or 2 points where I wish I could have skimmed over some details about costs and things in the book, but for the most part I found it really interesting and important to the story. Economists would probably be disappointed, but compared to most other fantasy books I've read this covers things far more thoroughly.<br/><br/>This book has a lot of grey areas without really ever getting into dark fantasy. Do you root for the noble who wants to protect his kingdom and king from chaos, but regards farmers and other commoners as little better than dogs? Do you root for the kindly noble who may mean well, but is often ignorant or spiteful in his actions?<br/><br/>I will say that this book had a point where I saw where the plot was going and thought it would keep following a predictable path only to throw me for a complete loop.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this book and look forward to continuing on with the series when I have a chance.",,,1,,,1,2014/02/10,,Like new,,

This book has a lot of point of view characters and starts with a lot of stories that appear to have nothing to do with each other...at first. It made me think I was reading an epic fantasy novel where technology replaces magic and aliens replace elves and dragons.<br/><br/>There is a ton of sci-fi concepts in here: memory/life backups, cloning, anti-aging/near immortality, worm holes, FTL. I'm probably missing some minor ones, but those are the biggies.<br/><br/>It's a world where space exploration is boring because wormholes make travel between planets instantaneous, and the idea of spending money on ships and sending them to the far reaches of space to explore is considered a waste.<br/><br/>That is until a mysterious event occurs on the edge of space prompts the need for the first space ship in centuries to be constructed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile you have a terrorist, a murder investigation and a whole lot of politics to contend with. It's a society that doesn't seem very far off from out own, save for the technological advances.<br/><br/>Mr. Hamilton does a great job at character development. And he makes you think about things. What would you do if you lived for multiple centuries, getting a youthful body every few decades or so as you needed (assuming you can afford it)? Would you stay married to the same person? Would you keep the same job?<br/><br/>My favorite characters/story lines was the main storyline with Wilson Kime the one time NASA pilot and now captain of the new constructed Second Chance.<br/><br/>The other I enjoyed most was probably Paula Myo and her investigations into both a murder and the case that eluded for over a hundred years involving a terrorist named Adam Elvin. She's not someone I could see myself being friends with (I'm not sure she has any anyways), but I can identify with several of her character traits.<br/><br/>My only (mostly minor) complaints are that some scenes go on too long (30 minutes of hang gliding, seriously?), and the way this book ends by setting up several cliff hangers.<br/><br/>I knew this was part of a series coming in, but I think the ending could have been better.<br/><br/>Overall though, a very enjoyable book and I'm looking forward to finishing the series with [b:Judas Unchained|45244|Judas Unchained (Commonwealth Saga, #2)|Peter F.

Clay was a sympathetic protagonist, and Gabe made for a fine catalyst, but neither are especially memorable in the pantheon of fantasy characters. The rest of the band is about the same.

One of my favorite fantasy series, Codex Alera does a very similar thing. Then of course there is Naruto. I'm sure there are numerous other examples but those are the first two that come to mind.<br/><br/>There are some similarities to both series but Mr. Wight definitely does a good job putting his own spin on the trope. The magic system is interesting enough, but so far it doesn't seem to be too well explained or very unique.<br/><br/>The supporting characters and the world building are both pretty good. I was hoping for a bit more of the magic school trope as our protagonist strives to rise above his station in life, but we'll see what the latter books hold.<br/><br/>I do like the contrast of a character whose much less powerful than everyone he encounters because it forces them (and therefore the author) to explore interesting ways to either use the limited magic they have or to simply work around it. Many of the work-arounds proved to be some of my favorite part of the story so far.<br/><br/>Things took a turn for the unexpected about 25% that definitely ramped up my interest in the series beyond just a story of an outcast whose determined to ""level-up"". These books seem pretty short (about 250 pages) compared to most fantasy I read which tends  to be door-stopping epics. <br/><br/>It makes for a nice change of pace and I already bought the second book to jump right into it.

Habit I guess? I can't speak to his other books, but from what I understand this book is far less grimdark than the previous two. Either way, I absolutely loved it. I was sucked in right from the beginning with one of the best first lines I've ever read:<br/><br/>""<i>IT IS IMPORTANT, when killing a nun, to ensure that you bring an army of sufficient size.</i>""<br/><br/>I'm a big sucker for magic school tropes. This one is pretty different from the rest. First of all it's set in a convent (as may be evident by the above quote). Secondly the girls are more akin to warrior monks than they are mages.<br/><br/>I like a well defined magic system. This seems to have the possibility of one, but we've learned very little of how the magic works. It is definitely intriguing, and I hope we learn a lot more in the rest of the series.<br/><br/>I also thought the characters were excellent too. Nona is a girl off to a bad start in life. This doesn't appear to be because she's a bad person, but rather than she's unfortunate enough to be put in bad situations with an unwillingness to sit passively by. <br/><br/>The supporting characters are pretty great too. All of the full nuns have new names based on inanimate objects. From Abbess Glass, who feels that lying is totally fine so long as it serves the right purpose to Sister Kettle who serves as somewhat of a mentor to Nona. There is a good variety of novice girls, each with different backgrounds and personalities that make them fully fleshed out into an interesting group to follow along with Nona as she ""levels up"".<br/><br/>Like many magic school books, this book has some of the usual tropes. Rival girls who get in Nona's way simply because of her background or abilities. However while this book does touch on some of those tropes, it doesn't dwell in them.<br/><br/>Much of this book is learning more about the world, training up be a badass, and wondering just what happened to end up Nona for her to end up where we find her at the beginning of the book.<br/><br/>There are a few interludes, including the one at the beginning that taunt the reader with hints of what's to come, while not really revealing too much about how we're going to get there.

The author re-used a handful of names and for the most part those spiders kept the same characteristics as previous ones, but there were times when I found some of them more or less likeable than previous incarnations.<br/><br/>In general I found myself rooting for the spiders than the humans, which I think is the main commentary of this book. People are awful to each other. We always have been, and most days it feels like we always will be.

That is also supposed to be horror too, but for me the fantastical elements made it really enjoyable for me. This book is in a similar vein.<br/><br/>I know Joe Hill changed his last name to try to distance himself from his much more famous father, but this book felt like it could easily have been written by his dad. There were a few easter eggs that seemed to nod to his father, including a mention of Mid World, which I thought was interesting because one of my first thoughts about this book was that Randall Flagg would be very interested in capturing some of these people to use as breakers.<br/><br/>I love the idea of traveling hidden ways and discovering secrets that was the core of the fantastical elements of this book. It reminded me a lot of [b:The Talisman|59219|The Talisman (The Talisman, #1)|Stephen King|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1170530286s/59219.jpg|3324421]. I feel bad comparing this so much to his father, but in this case I think that's a good thing, because he is one of the few horror writers I seem to like.<br/><br/>That said, this is definitely its own thing, even if it might happen to take place on another level of the Dark Tower. This book is the kind of horror that is more about the kind of things people do to each other and themselves than a book about a monster or killer doing awful things.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this book has those things, but not all the worst parts of this book are perpetrated by the villain, but the protagonists. I think that's another reason why it reminded me of a Stephen King book. I thought Vic McQueen was a great character who is incredibly flawed and terribly damaged.<br/><br/>I'm sure it's hard for Joe Hill not to have been influenced by his parents, and he talks a bit about growing up in a family of writers in his author's note at the end. I'm certainly much more inclined to pick up another book of his now after how much I enjoyed this one. I'm also really looking forward to seeing how the TV adaptation of this comes out.",,,1,,,1,2015/12/17,Audible,Like new,,

I'm hoping it ends up tied back to some of the world building aspects that really excited me.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this book was fine, but very dark. I'll need to be in the right mood to pick up the second book, but I do plan on picking it up eventually.

If you want a higher level history of video games, this may be a better choice that some of the other books out there.<br/><br/><b>Audiobook:</b> Gary Furlong does exactly what I want from a nonfiction narrator. He reads clearly with good pacing and inflection without getting in the way of the book. It does seem apparent he's not familiar with some of the concepts however as he mispronounces a few things (like GUI) that just made me cringe a little every time it occurred. <br/><br/>That said, I think while it doesn't benefit from audio like some fiction books do, it's a decent option.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I've lost count of how many books I've read on the history of video games. Some are on certain companies/technologies/games. Others have been purported to be a ""complete"" history. Most of those I've read have been good but are often lacking. This isn't a fault of those books so much as the fact that there is so much history to tell, inevitably you have to focus on some things at the expense of others.<br/><br/>Most of the overall history books I've read tend to focus very heavily on America and Japan as well as primarily on console gaming. This book sets out to tell a wider history and I felt it did a pretty good job of it. In addition to covering the usual topics we get numerous chapters on computer gaming as well as later chapters dealing with portable/phone gaming and online gaming.<br/><br/>There is also chapters dealing with gaming in Europe and other parts of Asian that seem to always go ignored in all the other books I've read. These chapters aren't as detailed as some of the others, but it was nice to see their addition and for me personally they offered the most new material.<br/><br/>I've typically been more of a computer gamer than a console gamer, so it was nice to more history about computer gaming beyond Space Wars on the PDP1 and Doom. The book spends time with a variety of computer platforms and how gaming evolved from simulations and mainframe gaming to the rise of gaming on the personal computer. I could probably read books focusing on just this part of gaming alone.<br/><br/>I knew almost nothing about gaming in Europe. I knew a little about it in South Korea and China, but not much more than I did about Europe. This book doesn't spend a ton of time on those subjects but it's still nice to see it included.<br/><br/>I grabbed this book on a daily deal, and I'm happy I did. While there was a lot of material I already knew about, there was a lot of things I didn't. I'm a sucker for good nonfiction books on gaming, computers and/or technology so this worked well for me. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a book that digs into some subjects others seem to neglect, or just want a higher level history that doesn't spend too much time on any one subject this is a pretty good option.",,,1,,,1,2018/04/16,Audible,Like new,,

I did slightly more rereading this year than last, but I've kept it below my goal of 10 or less so as to focus on new stuff. <br/><br/><br/>********************<br/>* Format Breakdown *<br/>********************<br/>Total AUDIO_BOOK Count: 61 (60.40%)<br/>Total BOOK Count: 7 (6.93%)<br/>Total EBOOK Count: 14 (13.86%)<br/>Total GRAPHIC_NOVEL Count: 19 (18.81%)<br/><br/>Part of total increase appears to be a huge spike in Graphic Novels this year. I nearly doubled the number I read in 2017, accounting for a 5% increase of my total consumption. That 5% drop seems to have come off of my audio books, despite their total also being up this year. <br/><br/>The number of physical books read continues to decline while ebooks consumption doubled.<br/><br/>*******************<br/>* Genre Breakdown *<br/>*******************<br/>Total FANTASY Count: 57 (56.44%)<br/>Total HISTORICAL Count: 2 (1.98%)<br/>Total HORROR Count: 2 (1.98%)<br/>Total HUMOR Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total NONFICTION Count: 6 (5.94%)<br/>Total SCIFI Count: 31 (30.69%)<br/>Total THRILLER Count: 2 (1.98%)<br/><br/>Hey look I read a lot of fantasy and a fair bit of Sci-Fi. I kept that line from my 2017 review, because it continues to be very true every year. <br/><br/>Despite reading 10 more fantasy books in 2018 than 2017, my percentage dropped slightly. Sci-fi consumption was also slightly down (in terms of percentage). So instead of last year's 90%, I'm down to a much more reasonable 87%!<br/><br/>The biggest deltas this year seems to be in terms of nonfiction and some horror. The latter is something I don't typically read unless it's basically dark fantasy.<br/><br/>***************************<br/>* Author Gender Breakdown *<br/>***************************<br/>Total MALE Count: 74 (73.27%)<br/>Total FEMALE Count: 26 (25.74%)<br/><br/>My ratio is about 2% better than last year, but still pretty unbalanced. I'm not necessarily looking for a 50% balance, but it'd be nice to get it closer. I added a few more new female authors to my list whose books I'll be picking up just as soon as they are published.<br/><br/>*********<br/>* Ratings *<br/>*********<br/>Average Rating: 3.83<br/>Total 1 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 2 Count: 3 (2.97%)<br/>Total 3 Count: 16 (15.84%)<br/>Total 4 Count: 73 (72.28%)<br/>Total 5 Count: 8 (7.92%)<br/><br/>As far as book selection, my average is up a bit this year again. It's once again hovering just under a 4 star rating for the year, so I'm doing pretty well. Of the 4 1&2 star rating books, three were book picks made by someone else. This is my first ever 1-star rating since joining Goodreads over 6 years ago. I'm even more stubborn about 1 star ratings than I am about 5 stars. I usually find some aspect of every book I like, but [b:Night's Master|882258|Night's Master  (Tales from the Flat Earth #1)|Tanith Lee|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1230090855s/882258.jpg|457123] was a total miss.<br/><br/>I had 2 more new 5 star books this year than last year. Of the eight books I gave 5 stars to, three of them were rereads. The percentage of 4 star books was also up this year. So I continue to doing a good job with my book selections overall.<br/><br/>Years Published:<br/>Total 1818 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 1940 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 1962 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 1975 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 1978 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 1985 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 1986 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 1987 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 1989 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 1991 Count: 2 (1.98%)<br/>Total 1996 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 1997 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 1998 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 1999 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 2000 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 2001 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 2002 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 2003 Count: 2 (1.98%)<br/>Total 2004 Count: 2 (1.98%)<br/>Total 2005 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 2007 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 2010 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 2011 Count: 2 (1.98%)<br/>Total 2012 Count: 2 (1.98%)<br/>Total 2013 Count: 5 (4.95%)<br/>Total 2014 Count: 4 (3.96%)<br/>Total 2015 Count: 5 (4.95%)<br/>Total 2016 Count: 13 (12.87%)<br/>Total 2017 Count: 15 (14.85%)<br/>Total 2018 Count: 30 (29.70%)<br/><br/>Decade Published:<br/>Total 1810 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 1940 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 1960 Count: 1 (0.99%)<br/>Total 1970 Count: 2 (1.98%)<br/>Total 1980 Count: 4 (3.96%)<br/>Total 1990 Count: 6 (5.94%)<br/>Total 2000 Count: 9 (8.91%)<br/>Total 2010 Count: 77 (76.24%)<br/><br/>Most of my reading continues to come from books published since 2010, and a good number (30) of my total were published in 2018.

I guess I'm not quite done with Brandon Sanderson's non-Cosmere stuff after all. 4.5 Stars.<br/><br/><b>Audiobook:</b> I don't believe I've listened to a book by Suzy Jackson before, but she does a good job. Her normal reading voice is a good fit for the main character and she does a few other voices as well making audio a good option here. I particularly liked her voice for Kimelynn.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>So after Mr. Sanderson's Reckoner series, I swore off his non-cosmere books for good. My tastes and Mr. Sanderson's work was starting to diverge apparently. When this was announced as a YA sci-fi series, I said: ""Nope, not for me."" I didn't even add it to my to-read pile in case I changed my mind later.<br/><br/>Fast forward oh, 6 weeks after it was released and I bought it. So obviously I have really great willpower!<br/><br/>The reality was that I was looking for something light and fun to listen to for my Christmas week driving (14+ hours round trip plus a bunch in between visiting friends and family) and this seemed to fit that bill. Even if I didn't like it very much, there was very little chance of it bringing down my holiday spirits.<br/><br/>Early on I was pretty so-so on the book. I didn't regret buying it, but I was thinking I might have been right to avoid it. Once the main story got going however I started to change my mind. For one thing the dumb humor that drove me nuts in the Reckoners books wasn't here. <br/><br/>There are jokes. Most of them aren't great, but they weren't purposely bad and annoying. Humor isn't Mr. Sanderson's strong suit. In my opinion his best humor often comes when he's not trying too hard.<br/><br/>So as always the world building is fantastic. Since it's sci-fi there is no magic system. However this is far from hard sci-fi so you could almost count his space ship technology as a sort of magic and in that regard I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I thought the characters were all pretty good too. I particularly enjoyed Kimelynn. She's my favorite. Spensa was far more likeable than David from the Reckoners series.<br/><br/>I'm interested in the bigger picture of what's going on with humanity. We get some insights near the end of the book, but mostly I had more questions than answers.<br/><br/>So now I'll be picking book 2 up on release day. Maybe Mr. Sanderson and I aren't drifting apart as I thought. I guess I just didn't like his Reckoners books that much.",,,1,,,1,2018/12/20,Audible,Like new,,

He does a variety of voices that really makes this a must listen. The second book is out in ebook, but not audio yet. I'll be waiting for the audio even though I really wanted to continue right into the second book.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>You'd think there would be no way to write the magic school trope without it feeling like a rehash of the countless other books/series that have done it before, but somehow I keep finding and enjoying new variations on the idea.<br/><br/>Mr. Rowe's take is no different. In particular I really enjoyed the magic system he created to server as the foundation of his school. Learning magic is part escape room, part D&D (or well I guess maybe all D&D).<br/><br/>There is also a good mystery element to this book that drives the main plot beyond our protagonist attending magic school and learning how to harness his newfound magic powers. The school wasn't the focus here so much as the setting. There looks to be a lot of interesting aspects to the world beyond its walls.<br/><br/>I thought the characters were all pretty good. Their is a decent variety of both male and female characters and all of them get their chance to shine, not just the protagonist. I appreciate a lot of the quirks/social anxiety of Corin. I'm not as bad as he is, but I can understand where he's coming from.<br/><br/>I'm terrible at names, so I can't remember anyone else whose name isn't included in the blurb. Corin's friends are made up of a summoner, and elementalist (I think?), a guardian and someone who refuses to divulge their attunement, but runs around with guns. I thought they all had something interesting to add to the story beyond being just a means of flushing out the magic system.<br/><br/>My only real complaint is the writing is a bit clunky at times. I'm not someone who thinks too much about the prose of books I read, so long as I'm being entertained. This book was very entertaining, but there were a few times when the dialogue or repetition of words pulled me out of the story, albeit very briefly. <br/><br/>Overall I found this book a lot of fun and plan to continue just as soon as the second book comes out in audio. As this is indie published, that's always a crap shoot. It does appear the author got word it was being recorded earlier this month, so hopefully that means it will be out sometime soon. I'll be eagerly awaiting its release.",,,1,,,1,2018/08/07,Audible,Like new,,

It's a high 4 though.<br/><br/>Early on I was definite I wanted to drop it 4, but as I got closer to the end I was less sure. I'm still a little iffy on it. This is really a story of two halves. The first half is slow sometimes to the point of being tedious.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if it was intentional or not. I certainly felt as frustrated as the characters at their lack of progress.<br/><br/>The second half of the book is truly excellent. The first part is what spoils a 5 star for me though. I'm trying to be a bit more frugal with what I give 5 stars to, to give that rating a bit more meaning.

Rowling|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1474154022s/3.jpg|4640799] on my ordering of the series.<br/><br/>There are several things this book has going for it to redeem all the miserable time of Harry feeling sorry for himself. <br/><br/>First it introduces Luna Lovegood, whose one of my favorite supporting characters.<br/><br/>Second it introduces the DA. This is a place where Harry really comes into his own. It also gives you a reprieve (for the most part) from all of his teenage angst.<br/><br/>Third is just how great Hermoine has become. I've always identified with her more than Harry or Ron. I like order and following the rules. I like books and the learning they can provide. I like being cautious and thinking things out. She's the voice of reason in a book full of teenage angst.<br/><br/>Fourth is the Weasely Twins. They have what could be argued as the best scene in the series in this book. While they are people I probably wouldn't get along with too well (you tell them Hermoine!), they sure go a long way to lighten things up.<br/><br/>And speaking of Weasely's, Ginny really finally comes into her own. She's smart and capable and moved on from fawning over Harry. <br/><br/>The final thing I'll highlight is Dolores Umbridge. This is someone I'm torn on. She is utterly obnoxious and frustrating. However, that is the point of her character, so Ms. Rowling does a fantastic job with her. I think simply coupled with Harry's obnoxious traits, it's just a bit too much for one book. <br/><br/>I also find her to be TOO much of an antagonist, and maybe a lost opportunity. If she was a little more like Fudge and less of a sadist, she could be a truly great villain, though maybe Rowling didn't think the subtlety of inaction would be apparent to her readers?<br/><br/>Overall this book is uneven, and I find how much I like it seems to vary with each reading.",,,6,,,0,,,,,

It took getting a free copy of the first book of this series to get me to finally give him a shot.<br/><br/>I keep coming back to Naruto not because this series is a knock-off of that, but because some of the notes it hits keep reminding me of my favorite parts of that series. I'd be really shocked if Wight isn't a fan/wasn't inspired by that or other Shonen fighting series.<br/><br/>This book starts off right where the last one left off, and Lindon is once again training to take on a challenge far beyond his power. It's not until he starts this trial (that reminded me slightly of the Chunin exams) that this book really gets good. <br/><br/>I was only going to read another 2-3 chapters and instead I stayed up an hour later than I intended just so I could finish. I also rushed right out to buy the next book.<br/><br/>This series has some really great characters. Lindon is likeable enough but he's kind of the typical protagonist for this kind of a story. I really love both Eithan and Yerin as well. Eithan is both mysterious and hilarious. The book also introduces another fantastic new character whose name I can't recall but he's a giant insane Dragon-Turtle so really what does it matter what his name is?<br/><br/>There were some pretty interesting developments with Lindon in this book and some pretty intriguing revelations about Eithan as well. I'm really looking forward to seeing where this series goes next.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how many people are reading Will Wight, but I'll be joining my friend in recommending him, at least to my friends who enjoy Shonen fighting series.<br/><br/>",,,1,,,1,2018/07/07,Amazon,unspecified,,

One of the main issues with those series is ""Power creep"". <br/><br/>The protagonist gets stronger and stronger so of course his opponents have to get stronger as a result. This one takes a slightly different approach. Mr. Wight ratchets up the power creep almost immediately without leveling our hero up. <br/><br/>So instead Lindon finds himself in a world where everyone is not only far more powerful than himself, but everyone he's ever known in his life. A lot of the cleverness of this series revolves around how he still makes his way through conflict despite the huge power gap.<br/><br/>However I still feel like the power creep is far worse than normal for a series like this, so I'm hoping the huge spike was mostly a one time thing and that it doesn't hit ridiculous levels in the next book.<br/><br/>I will say that once I had more time to read I made steady progress again.

The best books always make it hard to put down. When you do as much audio as I do, that often results in staring at walls or sitting in your car longer than you should just to squeeze in some extra time.<br/><br/>This book had me find an extra 90 minutes of time yesterday because I refused to stop for the day without knowing how it ended. That's a lot of wall staring!<br/><br/>With so many great characters, it's hard to pick a favorite. I think that's one of things that endears this series to me so much. A lot of the characters are broken in one way or another, but they persevere because honestly they don't have much choice.<br/><br/>I think my favorite part of this book was the interactions between Raith and Suri. Raith had some really great one-liners, and they usually came during a conversation with her.<br/><br/>As someone whose loved/roleplayed Elves for a long time, I struggle at times with Mr. Sullivans interpretation. Most of them are downright awful. I miss the idea of more playful/wise elves.

Despite being a prequel to Riyria it's so far in the past that we basically know almost nothing. There are some pretty big mysteries I want answer to, and so far we haven't gotten much. <br/><br/>We did learn a lot more about one character in particular, but it was one of those things where now I have a whole bunch of new questions rather than satisfaction at what I discovered.<br/><br/>Of course this is book 3 in a now 6 book series, so there are a lot of pages for me to get some answers.

It was really long at nearly 40 hours.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>These days I primarily read fantasy. I especially love epic fantasy. Tom Clancy seems to write epic political thrillers. I don't know how else to describe it. Just like epic fantasy spends a bunch of time on the details of the world (or in some series describing the clothes and the food in far too much detail), this book gets into the details of just about everything rather than simply telling a spy/political thriller.<br/><br/>I imagine just like the fact that I love epic fantasy, when many others do not, there are people who like this kind of detail. I don't however. I'm much more willing to accept some of the ridiculous plot details that drive this story than I am to be excited listening to details about how certain procedures or the technical specs of military equipment. There were parts where I just wanted the story to get on with things.<br/><br/>I had no idea just how long this book was when I picked it up. I was looking for something ""quick"" to fill some time waiting for a hold from the library to come in and I ended up having to speed up the audio just to get through it fast enough.<br/><br/>I know I've seen the movie with the same title, but my recollection was that was a reboot of sorts since they switched from Harrison Ford to a much younger Ben Affleck, but beyond that I don't remember that much. I do recall it was my least favorite of the Jack Ryan movies.<br/><br/>My main issue with the book however isn't it's length or somewhat ridiculous plot points, but that ""the villains"" are just downright awful. There are a lot of antagonists to Jack Ryan, but the worst is basically the only female character whose not simply a supporting role. She's awful. Terribly written. I can't really get into why without Clancy's disdain for liberals is probably more apparent in this book than any other of his I've read so far.<br/><br/>I've talked about my dislike of Jack Ryan in some of my reviews for previous Ryan books, but the conflict in this one was almost too much. A fight between two people I don't really like. Jack was a lot better in this one than in some of the earlier books, but at times I just wanted to put the book down as a result.<br/><br/>I was surprised by how much I ended up enjoying the end of this book after struggling through much of the early parts, which is why I rounded up to 3 stars instead of down to 2. I'll probably continue on with the series (there are a few others I still want to read for some reason) at some point, but I figure I'll take a break until much later this year if not next year before doing so.<br/><br/>I'd like to add in more thrillers (especially political thrillers) but so far I've not found the books to be nearly enjoyable as I recall the movies being, which is typically not the case for me at all.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

This is definitely a different book from that. <br/><br/>Instead of a single narrative about Vaelin told in the form of a flashback, we are instead given three new point of view characters in addition to Vaelin and the interludes from the perspective of the chronicler.<br/><br/>Two of the characters, Frentis and Lyrna will be instantly familiar from the first novel. The fourth, Riva, was probably my favorite. As a new character she probably got the most character development of the four. I think having two male POVs and two female ones gave the novel a good balance.<br/><br/>I found Lyrna's story to start a bit slow, but I was quickly grabbed by the book as a whole and eventually sucked into her narrative as well. Much like [b:Blood Song|13569581|Blood Song (A Raven's Shadow, #1)|Anthony  Ryan|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1363126955s/13569581.jpg|19148922] this is one of those books that grabbed hold and didn't let go. I hated to put it down and loved to pick it back up.<br/><br/>I'm glad for the format change as I think Mr. Ryan was able to tell a much larger story as a result. There were parts of the story where the various POV's overlapped, but there were also a lot of things that would have gone otherwise unmentioned if he stuck with just Vaelin's story.<br/><br/>We are once again given some excellent action scenes, though probably fewer overall than the first. While the first book was more a hero's journey, this book is more epic fantasy with larger implications to the realm as a whole.<br/><br/>We get answers to many of the big questions I had from the first novel too. Often times it seems like authors jealously guard all their book's secrets and wait until the last possible minute to reveal them. Not so with this series. I felt there were several big reveals in parts 2 and 3 that other authors might have held back.<br/><br/>There is plenty of new questions to take the place of those that are answered that kept me wanting to keep listening and find out what would happen next.<br/><br/>Mr. Ryan has put himself in a precarious position of writing two really excellent novels in what I believe is supposed to be a trilogy. Now the expectations are that much higher for the finale of what has quickly become one of my favorite series.<br/><br/>If you haven't read this book yet, do yourself a favor and pick it up.

First you have Lizanne, who I always just think of as Jane Bond in my head. Then there is Clay, who's got a bit of an Indiana Jones vibe to his story. Finally there is sailor Captain Hilemore. <br/><br/>Their narratives are all tied together with Dragon Blood. Added to the mix is Sirius. I don't recall if he was introduced in the last book as a minor character, but he certainly wasn't a POV in that. Much like Hilemore in the last book, his story felt mostly disconnected from the other three until near the very end. Unlike Hilemore however, I had a much better idea how his story was going to fit in with the rest well in advance.<br/><br/>I found the start of the book a bit slow.

Once the book got going however I definitely enjoyed it. <br/><br/>Clay's story started the slowest of the four, although I didn't find Sirius much better. Even Lizanne who's definitely my favorite of the series felt like she was meandering a bit before her story got going again.<br/><br/>The world building continues to be excellent. We learn a lot more about the Dragons and the blood blessed, and the nature of many of the mysteries from the first book. Clay's story in particular reveals quite a bit of interesting details. I really like the world Mr. Ryan built here.<br/><br/>Based on his previous series, I feel like Mr. Ryan's good at writing both beginnings and middles, but struggles with endings.

Either way, I was disappointed enough in that book, that I was reluctant to pick this one up. I had planned to wait on reviews from people I trusted to come out before getting it. Then a review copy fell into my lap.<br/><br/>This book is kind of a hodge podge of several things I love: Mistborn, Indiana Jones, James Bond, and Dragons. And if that's not enough there is also high sea adventure, and pirates! That may sound like a mess, but Mr. Ryan does a great job in blending those elements together. I also can't guarantee all of those things were influences on this book, but they are things I thought about as I was reading.<br/><br/>Mistborn has one of my all time favorite magic systems. This one feels similar, only a little less structured, and with only 4 known types of abilities. The main similarity is the idea of imbibing something in order to do magic, and that only a small number of people are born with the ability. Beyond that they are quite different.<br/><br/>My favorite character is Lizanne, who is basically Jane Bond. Her story line was always my favorite, and I really want to know more about the training she went through. I hope we get some flashbacks or possibly her training new recruits in future books, but then I'm a sucker for the magic school trope.<br/><br/>Clay was also a great character, and a more reluctant protagonist then Lizanne. His story was reminiscent of an Indiana Jones story, with him being basically nothing like him. If anyone is Jones it's maybe his uncle.<br/><br/>The final protagonist, Lt. Hilemore was enjoyable enough, but I spent much of the book wondering how his story fit in with the other two. Rest assured it's made clear by the end of the story, but it takes awhile. That doesn't mean his story wasn't interesting, it just felt disconnected from the rest of the book for me. With him you get high seas battles and pirates!<br/><br/>None of that even scratches the surface of the great supporting cast. Each subplot has it's own supply of interesting characters. And if 3 interesting protagonists influenced by different elements, and a great supporting cast isn't enough. There are Dragons. And really, isn't that enough?<br/><br/>Overall, I'm glad I got this is a review copy because I really enjoyed this book. I just hope he can take his time on the sequels because I felt like his last book suffered from rushing to completion to meet a deadline. I love getting new books in a series once a year, but I'm willing to wait longer if the author needs more time. I'm hoping he'll be able to bring this to a more satisfying conclusion than his previous series.",,,1,,,1,2016/06/15,Review Copy,Like new,,

The new story, Zoo Day, was pretty enjoyable and is a mix of Dresden and a few others that I won't name so as not to spoil anything. <br/><br/>If you're a fan of the series and all caught up, this is a decent way to tide you over, but I'd say only about half to the stories are really worth reading the others while not bad don't add much to the series in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you're not caught up, avoid this one until you are.

There was a big debate about if this book is YA or not. Personally I don't think it matters very much. To me it's about whether I connect with a book, and not how it's marketed.<br/><br/>This books started out pretty strong for me. We're introduced to Kell and his awesome fashion accessory, and the idea of ""parallel"" Londons, where he is one of a very few who can travel between them. Soon after we meet a thief in one of the Londons named Lila. <br/><br/>Both have interesting premises, but I had a hard time connecting with them(or any character for that matter). I found most of the early part of the book slow and relatively uneventful. I wasn't bored, but it felt as though very little happened at times. While I tend to prefer character-driven stories like this, it requires caring for the characters more than I did here.<br/><br/>The world building is interesting, but I found the description misleading. To me the concept of ""alternate"" Londons made me think they would share more in common with each other than a name. They are vastly different. It didn't feel like alternate versions of the same city at all. Still, I found the idea of world hopping magic appealing, and the history of how each developed varied enough.<br/><br/>The magic ""system"" is almost non-exist. I tend to prefer well-defined magic systems, and this feels underdeveloped. Considering the Antari are so rare, I'd have been interesting in exploring this aspect more than it was. Hopefully that will come in the later books.<br/><br/>Once the story got going near the middle I was a lot more interested. However I felt like after taking too long to start, the ending was rushed. I probably would have liked this one a bit more with different pacing.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this book, and will continue on with the series, but I'm not in a rush to do so.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

However, since this is LitRPG, there are some downsides to the unabridged format. On paper you'd scan over the various stats, character sheets and item descriptions that Mr. Daniels must painstakingly read out to you.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I'm still not sure what I feel about LitRPG. I've been playing WoW for nearly 15 years now and I've spent a lot of time out of the game reading about the game, strategies, stats, gear, etc. So the idea of reading a book about someone playing a game works well for me. I imagine it won't work as well for others who'd rather just play a game than listen to one.<br/><br/>However so far my experience with the genre is that it's not being written very well. I don't have a large sample size to base that one, so I could be wrong. Just two authors so far. My main gripe is the book could have used more editing. This book has a lot of repeated words/dialogue and some cringeworthy speeches.<br/><br/>It also suffers a bit too much from lack of diversity. I don't necessarily mean that in terms of race or gender, but that could be applied too. I thought all of the characters in the book were fine, but they felt too much alike. They are your fairly standard non-asshat dude gamer. They were all likeable, but not everyone who games is the same. Yes some people swear a lot (I'm guilty of this myself) but not everyone talks like that constantly.<br/><br/>Not to mention in a group of 6 players there is only one girl. He does add some more female players later in the book, but for a book that's supposed to be set in the future I find it hard to believe the ratio of men to women players is 5:1.<br/><br/>That said, I wasn't picking this up to be something deep or eloquently written. I wanted a fun book and that's what I (mostly) got. I really liked that this book while focused one character added a bunch of other players working together as well as in opposition to the protagonist rather than just a bunch of NPCs and quests. I also like the idea of a game where you can shape the growth of the world so much.<br/><br/>I'll probably pick up book two, but I'm torn on if I want to read the side story book first or not. For now, I'll probably hold off a bit until I get the itch for another light read.",,,1,,GaiusPrimus,1,2018/05/21,Audible,Like new,,

If this book isn't better than that one, it's a very close tie. We're talking too close to call. Either way it was another easy 5 star rating for me.<br/><br/>Much like the last book it's split up into three subplots following Vlora, Ben and Mikael. There were times when I was annoyed to leave one story for another, but then I got sucked into that subplot and I was just as annoyed at leaving that story as well.<br/><br/>If had to choose however, I'd probably give the slight edge to Mikael. I'm a sucker for the spy stories. Ben is a very close second though, in particular because I think he's had the most interesting character development of the series thus far. Vlora's story was also quite good, just slightly behind the other two.<br/><br/>I don't feel like this book suffers at all from middle book syndrome either. I'm very eager to get my hands on the third book, but I felt like he got each story to a good stopping point while setting things up nicely for the ending.<br/><br/>There were some more fantastic world building, a few really great surprises, plenty of actions and a bunch of interesting characters that got me finding reasons to keep listening just a little bit longer each day.<br/><br/>I'm hard-pressed to recommend this series if you haven't read his original Powder Mage trilogy first, but I think it is written in such a way that you could. You'd miss out on a lot of backstory and detail that way.<br/><br/>Either way I'll continue to recommend Brian McClellan while eagerly awaiting the final book of this series to see if he can pull off a 5-star conclusion.

I often found every time I was settling in and just enjoying the story, Richter would say something obnoxious. Sometimes it was just lame jokes, but more often than not he's making some stupid sexist comment. I can't tell if this is meant to be satire/commentary on people Mr. Kong has gamed with, or if he truly thinks Richter is ""cool"".

This book focuses heavily on three entirely new characters: Captain Chiang whose a member of the military responsible for rooting out Fallers, a forest warden named Florian and astronaut Ry Evine.<br/><br/>I struggled a lot with Chiang's character, which I think was by intent. He's not inherently evil, but he tends to be a bit too determined to stop the fallers at any cost. Florian on the other hand was fantastic. It was largely his part of the story that sucked me into this book. Ry Evine was interesting enough but his story felt much smaller compared with the other two.<br/><br/>Much like all of the other Commonwealth books, the story is full of cool tech (albeit much less than some of the others dues to reasons that explained in the book), memorable characters and huge stakes.<br/><br/>There are some other aspects of this book I really enjoyed, but talking about those would get into spoiler territory, something I try to avoid when writing reviews.<br/><br/>If you liked previous Commonwealth books, or if you were so-so on the last book and haven't picked this one up yet, I think it was well worth it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this book and I was especially happy with how he wrapped everything up a the end.

The idea of a disease leading to a new minority of people who trapped inside their own bodies makes for an interesting premise and some pretty creative world building.<br/><br/>I wish more time was spent in the virtual world inhabited by many of the Haydn's, but since this is primarily a detective/murder story it's a bit hard to do so. Mr. Scalzi does ramp things up in the physical world with some pretty interesting new designs for Threeps (the electronic bodies that Haydn's can use to interact with the physical world).<br/><br/>The premise of this one is built around a few Threeps that can have their heads taken off in a sort of blood sport (minus the actual blood). As a fan of both traditional sports and some esports, this feels like a little of both. I'm not sure I'd be interested enough to actually watch it myself however.<br/><br/>It definitely added to the world building of the first book, and seems like the kind of thing that would emerge from the world that Mr. Scalzi created.<br/><br/>The book is again told from the point of view an ambiguous protagonist. We still don't know whether Chris is male or female, and it doesn't matter (which I think is the main point). Chris is mostly competent at his job as they serves as junior investigator to his more seasoned partner who doesn't take shit from anyone.<br/><br/>We get to meet some more of Chris's roommates in this book (at least I don't really remember any of them apart from Tony from the first one) but there isn't a ton of depth to most of the characters beyond the protagonist, his partner and maybe his parents. There really isn't a lot of time for much character development.<br/><br/>This is the second book in a series, but I think Mr. Scalzi did a good job in making it read like a stand alone. I feel like you start here and not be too confused, then circle back to read the first book and/or the novella.<br/><br/>This one was pretty short and I tore through it quickly but very much enjoyed it.

Not only is Nona Grey a fantastic protagonist, most of the other Nuns are Novices are fantastic as well. It probably helps that I love a good fantasy school trope, but Mr. Lawrence's spin on it is pretty unique compared to all the others I've read.<br/><br/>The world building is really intriguing, but not explored as much as I'd like. I want to know more about the ancient people and their technology. I was also hoping we got some more information on the magic system in this book, so I was a bit disappointed in that regard.<br/><br/>My main gripe was that the primary antagonist felt a bit too much like your standard spoiled rich kid who hates the protagonist simply for being poor. I know those people exist in reality, but it just feels a bit overused, especially in the fantasy school trope. It would have been nice if there was more depth to her character.<br/><br/>That aside, I'm really eager to see where things go in what I believe is the final book. I think I read that Mr. Lawrence has already finished writing it, so hopefully it will be out early next year. <br/><br/>I've seen comments about this ending on a cliffhanger, but I thought compared to the first book this one ends in a much better place. Do I want to know what happens next? Of course I do.

Mr. Rothfuss's narrative, supporting characters and beautiful prose kept me interested in the story despite this.<br/><br/>With the sequel we find Kvothe is a little older, and thankfully a little wiser. As the story progresses, he is humbled, and bested on several occasions, and by the end of book I started to like him rather than loathe him as I mostly did through [b:The Name of the Wind|186074|The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)|Patrick Rothfuss|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1270352123s/186074.jpg|2502879].<br/><br/>With this book we also get several changes of scenery. About half of book follows Kvothe on adventures outside of the University where he always seems to be especially arrogant and stupid to me.<br/><br/>He is a lot more cautious and humble outside of that setting. This doesn't prevent him from being his own worst enemy from time to time, but it is reduced to a more tolerable level for my liking.<br/><br/>Mr. Rothfuss loves to embed stories within stories within stories, and this book is no different. There are some really great stories told that seem unrelated to main narrative at times, but you really have to wonder.<br/><br/>I like the idea of a ""bard"" main character rather than the stereotypical fighter/magician type. Through most of two books Kvothe travels not with a sword, but a lute.<br/><br/>My favorite part of this series has to be the supporting cast. In particular I love Auri and Devi, and want to know more about both. Like Kvothe I'm intrigued by Denna, and want to know what secrets she's hiding.<br/><br/>His friends Wil and Sim and the university are great as well. Mr. Rothfuss introduces some interesting new supporting characters in this book as well. I particularly liked Tempi, and learning about the Adem.<br/><br/>I blew through this much lengthier sequel in about a week, and if not for work, I probably would have finished it much sooner. <br/><br/>I had been avoiding staring this series for the very situation I now find myself in: stuck waiting for the 3rd and final book to come out.

Eventually I stalled out though.<br/><br/>The military aspects of those books seemed very realistic. Maybe a bit too realistic. I found many of the characters unlikeable and the events of the books hard to read at times.<br/><br/>When this book was announced I was excited because it sounded more my speed. I'm not a huge fan of dark fantasy these days, but it's still more in my wheelhouse than military/urban fantasy. <br/><br/>I didn't realize this was going to be a novella at the time I pre-ordered it. So when it arrived I was a bit surprised at how short it was. As a big fan of epic fantasy which are often characterized by overly long door-stopping tomes, I was a bit underwhelmed. I'm not sure I'm a fan of the recent trend of novella trilogies.<br/><br/>All that said, I enjoyed this book a lot. Apparently it's been influenced by Warhammer 40k. A friend told me its influence is VERY heavy. I've never read any of those books or played the tabletop game, so I had no idea. As such I found the world building pretty interesting.<br/><br/>Most importantly however I really liked Heloise as a protagonist. She could be a bit juvenile for a teenager, but she also seems to live in a bleak world where I probably wouldn't be in a hurry to grow up quickly either.<br/><br/>As always, I love a good magic system. We get some hints of it here. From the very start the idea of magic is evil. The premise of the series revolves around it. I found myself wondering is magic really like the law and rumors say, or is that all a lie? For me that was the most interesting thing to find out. I still have a lot more questions about it however (and many theories) so I hope we get more answers in the next 2 novellas.<br/><br/>Despite its short length, I thought Mr. Cole does a good job in setting up the world and building (an albeit very obvious) conflict that will likely carry the rest of the series forward. There are some pretty good supporting characters in the book along with Heloise that I thought rounded the story out well. In particular I liked her friend Basina and Basina's father. One of my major issues with his previous books was I didn't really like most of his characters, and I'm happy to see that wasn't the case here.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this may be Mr. Cole's best offering so far, especially if you're not a fan of military fantasy. It's a dark story, but well written and I'm looking forward to seeing where he takes things next.",,,1,,,1,2018/02/20,Amazon,Very good,,

This isn't a book you read for it's in deep plot and complex characters. It's popcorn, plain and simple.<br/><br/>With my usual ""no spoilers"" policies for review, I won't talk about the technologies used at all, other than to say there is nothing ground breaking there. Mr. Scalzi makes use of some well used ideas, but combines them in some fun ways. <br/><br/>He doesn't go into a lot of depth on how it works, making this about as far from hard sci-fi as you can get. He gives you just enough of an explanation to set things up, then moves on.<br/><br/>The aliens in this book are diverse and interesting, though again their isn't a lot of depth there. You don't always get a good feel for who the majority of the alien species are or why they are fighting. Really the variety of species is mostly to offer a variety of combat scenarios the main character has to deal with.<br/><br/>I was satisfied by the ending, but their are enough lingering questions that I plan to check out other books in the series when I get some more time.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Then again, they also would put much stock in the notion of actually having password protected accounts, or care much about money so long as they could keep hacking away.<br/><br/>I found the first section about MIT is the 50's and 60's interesting, but often very slow. I feel like Mr. Levy spent too much time harping on the Hacker Ethic. I guess that was sort of the point of the book he set up out to write, but I would have preferred more of an account of the people and accomplishments.<br/><br/>The section on the 70's with the Homebrew Computer Club, Woz and the early days of apple might be my favorite. My first computer was an Apple IIgs in the late 80's. It's the only Apple product I own, and probably a long way from the original Apple II Woz designed in the 70's, but it still holds a special place in my heart. Without it I'm not sure if I'd work in computers today. I never tore it apart to learn how it worked or learned to code on it, but it sparked an interest in computers that has yet to fade.<br/><br/>The section on the 80's and Sierra and the early days of PC gaming might have been my favorite. I loved a lot of Sierra games in the 90's, in particular King's Quest 6/7 and all 3 Gabriel Knight games. I've backed several former Sierra developers on Kickstarter the last 2 years. It was interesting to read about the early days of that company and the games that laid the foundation for the games I loved as a kid.<br/><br/>The final brief section on Richard Stallman was so-so. I have a love/hate relationship with Mr. Stallman. The guys comes off as kind of an asshole. But without him/GNU, I doubt Linux would have ever taken off like him, and that powers so much of the things I love, including all my various Android devices. <br/><br/>I'm a big proponent of the open source movement that came out of his efforts, but don't necessarily agree that all software should be free and shared. I think there is a lot of merit shared code and my job is made easier by some of the more prominent open source projects out there. <br/><br/>However, it's unreasonable to think that someone is going to want to pay quality software developers for the sake of simply writing good code to share. And it's unreasonable to expect people to write quality software for free in their spare time. I think Mr. Stallman's unwillingness to concede this has hurt his own cause in many ways.<br/><br/>Overall this was a pretty good read, though it got a bit slow and repetitive in places, and less detailed that I would have liked on others. It makes me want to pick up a few more books that get more detailed on the early days of Apple and gaming companies in the 80's and 90's.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The blurb really didn't excite me, so I decided to borrow this from the library and ended up having my hold come in much earlier than I'd planned.<br/><br/>The first few chapters didn't really pull me in. Aster is an oppressed ""lower deck"" woman who seems to have some kind of background in medicine/healing. Everything changed for me a few chapters in when we discover there is some sort of mystery surrounding the suicide of Aster's mother.<br/><br/>To me the mystery aspect of this book was the most interesting/intriguing. I think if that part had been included in the book blurb (goodreads has an extra paragraph that hints a bit at the mystery that my copy of the book didn't have on the back) I might have been interested in reading it beforehand. <br/><br/>I found the characters well-developed, and extremely complex. These are people who have been forced to suffer a great deal. Some of the characters are broken. Likely all of them are to some degree. Aster seems able to rise above it most of the time, but even she is not immune.<br/><br/>The world-building was pretty interesting too. The story takes place on a generation-ship, with a rigid class system. We learn some more about the ship as it goes on, but the finer details never really come. It's largely a character-driven story.<br/><br/>The oppression aspects make this hard to read. It is very reflective of the ways in which minorities have long been treated. The abuse, the demeaning behavior, and all around atrocities are hard to stomach. They should be though. This is the horrible kind of behavior humans, especially those of privilege have been doing for centuries to those who happen to be born into a ""lower"" class.<br/><br/>I generally read to escape. Things aren't exactly very happy right now. That made this book very hard to read at times. However the mystery that Aster was investigating really sucked me in.<br/><br/>It's also so well written that it was less off-putting to me as it might have otherwise been. It's quite an impressive debut novel from Rivers Solomon.<br/><br/>There are some circles out there who are angry at this type of Science-Fiction because it holds up a mirror and if they are being honest they don't like what they see reflected back at them. I'm not one of those people, but I generally don't go out of my way to read this sort of thing.<br/><br/>I'm glad this was picked because I think it's important to get uncomfortable at a book like this because it can be so close to non-fiction at times. I will definitely be more interested in picking up Rivers Solomon's next book as a result.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

This book is no different. He speaks clearly with good volume and inflection and does a variety of voices that make for an excellent audiobook. <br/><br/>I do however have some reservations. One of the drawbacks to Unabridged can be that some text is meant to be scanned/skimmed in a book, but must be read its entirety for the audio version. This books suffers from that. I feel it's also made worse by adding audio dings/music like you're leveling up in a game. In a game I appreciate it. In this book, I found that a bit irritating, especially when most of the text that followed was long and tedious.<br/><br/>None of this is the narrator's fault and he does a great job despite the source material not always translating 100% well in an audio format. None of this was enough to put me off of continuing the series in audio because Mr. Podehl does that good of a job and this otherwise is the type of book that works well in audio.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I first heard of ""LitRPG"" on the Sword & Laser podcast a few months ago. Mr. Kong labels himself as <i>""The Father of American LitRPG""</i>. American is a key word here because Japanese Manga and Anime has been telling this kind of story for over a decade. I also have read other books that are very close in style to this, albeit maybe less explicit on including all the stats/character sheets of everyone involved. <br/><br/>I'd put this book in a similar vein as books like [b:Ready Player One|9969571|Ready Player One (Ready Player One, #1)|Ernest Cline|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1500930947s/9969571.jpg|14863741] or [b:NPCs|22088245|NPCs (Spells, Swords, & Stealth, #1)|Drew  Hayes|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400095217s/22088245.jpg|41426688], both of which I enjoyed more than this book. The idea of being trapped in a fantasy video game first crossed my radar in the early 2000s with the anime <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.hack//Sign"">.hack//Sign</a>.<br/><br/>That all said, after nearly 2 decades as a D&D player and over 13 years playing World of Warcraft, this style of story really appeals to me. <br/><br/>This book has many of the usual tropes present in any number of animes of this genre. The main character is a ""dude-bro"" although thankfully not 100% of the time. The book also severely lacks in female characters. The few that there are serve mostly as quest givers or providers of information with no real agency to speak of.<br/><br/>Richter comes off as your stereo-typical ""elite"" gamer dude part of the time, and someone who actually seems to genuinely care about the people of The Land the rest of the time. He grew on me as a character, but I could stand fewer of his lame jokes and sexist comments.<br/><br/>Overall the writing is fine, but not great. Some of the dialogue (beyond the aforementioned jokes and sexist comments) can be cringeworthy. It's important to note however that I wasn't reading this book for a deep wow factor. It's one of those popcorn books where you just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride. <br/><br/>The ride was pretty good. The setting was established, some mysteries were set-up for the series and mostly our protagonist did what any new RPG player does: complete quests, explore, fight stuff and level up.<br/><br/>I found the book entertaining enough that I not only picked up the second book right away, but I rolled a new character in WoW because it really got me itching to level my own character. If you're into the whole RPG/leveling thing and aren't put off by the dude-bro stuff, this book may be worth checking out. I hope as it goes on we get some more depth to our protagonist and some actual female characters with some agency.",,,1,,,1,2017/11/04,Audible,Like new,,

Ethan isn't a very likeable character, in particular because of his prejudices towards woman. Athos as a society is just so strange to me. My initial thought was this was an inspiration to those Men's Rights idiots, except they want women to be subservient to them, and not to have nothing to do with them at all.<br/><br/>I had to look up the year this book was published. A society where homosexuality in book from 1986 seems pretty progressive. Although the attitudes of other characters in the book towards that seems appropriate to that time, so maybe not all that progressive.<br/><br/>Once Ethan got off Athos and met up with Elli Quinn the book got going a bit more to me. However it took awhile to really get a feel for what was going on, and care all that much about poor Ethan and his quest for new Ovarian samples with which to sustain the population of his planet.<br/><br/>There is mention of Miles Vorkosigan, but sadly he doesn't make an appearance.

Mr. Wexler found what I feel was the perfect balance of military battles, political intrigue and an interesting magical system that made it one of my top reads of 2015. I don't give 5 star ratings to books likely, so that fact that the final 3 books of this 5-book series have gotten one should tell you how much I liked it.<br/><br/>The characters are fantastic. This is especially true of Winter. I think the main reason I didn't enjoy this one quite as much as the last two, was that her story felt like it took a little longer to get going.

I found myself listening a bit longer each day just so I could squeeze in an extra chapter here or there.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge military fan, but the way Mr. Wexler writes these battles make it more than apparent how much he is.

I thought he was a good fit for the series overall, and makes listening in audio a great choice.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I was very late coming to this series, but I nearly listened to it all in one go. That should be a good indicator at how much I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>This series has one of the best magic systems I've encountered, and I'm always a sucker for that. The characters are fantastic too. There is a warrior monk, a bunch of badass women, and if that wasn't enough it also has a heroic bard or two. Fantasy books could always do with some more bards in my opinion.<br/><br/>It also has some of the best secondary ones I've ever read. Wanda Cutter deserves her own spin-off series. A few of the characters added in this book seemed to come out of nowhere however. Apparently one of them was introduced in some of the novellas. I didn't read those so it made their inclusion feel very strange to me. It was as if I had skipped a chapter or two in one of the previous books.<br/><br/>I did struggle a bit with the character development at times, but even a few I had a hard time sympathizing with for much of the series grew on me by the end.<br/><br/>Much like the last book this one focused a bit more on the human politics than the demon war than I'd have liked. However it was important to finish setting things up for the finale. I think it was handled pretty well, but it took me a bit to get completely sucked into the book as a result. It also made the ending feel a bit on the rushed side. <br/><br/>Still, I thought this was another solid entry in the series, and I was happy with where things leave off. I could happily read a sequel series (or that Wanda Cutter spin-off), but if we don't get any more from the universe Mr. Brett built, I'll be fine with that too.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this series to anyone who enjoys darker fantasy and loves cool magic systems.",,,1,,,1,2017/12/31,Audible,Like new,,

Unlike a fiction book, my main thing from the narrator I want is clearly spoken and good inflection. It can be very easy for the narrator to get in the way of a nonfiction book, and thankfully Mr. Sanders doesn't do that here. Audio is definitely a decent  option for this book.<br/> <br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I've always been interesting in knowing more about Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX. This book proved to be a good resource for that. It's grown a little dated now, especially on the SpaceX front as things are getting very interesting for SpaceX since its publication. I'd love to see an update on both companies in another 3-5 years time.<br/><br/>The similarities of Musk and Steve Jobs are quite startling to me. The author discusses it, and outlines why he feels they are quite different, but I'm not sure I agree.<br/><br/>Musk seems a bit more likeable, but it could simply be that he cares more about his public image than Jobs did. Both seems to be polarizing in that some love them and many hate them. The amount of credit they get also seems to be higher than each deserved too. However I feel that you can't argue that their respective companies wouldn't have been nearly as successful without them.<br/><br/>Even if you don't think Musk offered anything on the technical side of things, his belief in both companies and his willingness to stake so much of his own money on both pushed them through the time periods where either company would have easily failed if owned by someone else.<br/><br/>I was less interested in Mr. Musk's personal life and upbringing, so I found those parts a bit slow. However I think their inclusion is important to the book to get a better understanding of who Elon Musk is, and what drives him.<br/><br/>Overall I thought this was a pretty good book. I've been following both Tesla and SpaceX for a few years, and I'll continue to do so for the foreseeable future. I hope both companies continue to be successful, because I feel like science has always been one of the strengths of America, and it's been something we seem to be taking for granted lately.",,,1,,,1,2017/05/28,Audible,Like new,,

Then again if you read my reviews that's not a surprise. Last year I made an effort to read more stuff from other genres, but my efforts in that regard this year have reverted a bit.

I'm not striving for a 50/50% ratio here, but I'd like make sure I'm not missing out on great books due to gender bias, especially since 3 of my top 10 reads this year were written by woman.<br/><br/>*********<br/>* Ratings *<br/>*********<br/>Average Rating: 3.75<br/>Total 2 Count: 4 (4.94%)<br/>Total 3 Count: 17 (20.99%)<br/>Total 4 Count: 55 (67.90%)<br/>Total 5 Count: 5 (6.17%)<br/><br/>As far as book selection, my average is up a bit this year. It's once again hovering just under a 4 star rating for the year, so I'm doing pretty well.

There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.</i><br/><br/>It's hard to review the final book of a series, especially one as long and as old as as the Wheel of Time without including some personal history and talking about the series as a whole. Many folks have been at it the whole 23 years. Many others for at least 10. This is a series where I came late to the party. <br/><br/>I first heard about/was recommended this series by a good friend of mine back in college in the early 2000s. I wasn't much of a reader in those days, with priorities on other things. I mostly forgot it for the next 10 years or so. It wasn't until I heard about [a:Robert Jordan|6252|Robert Jordan|http://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1175475715p2/6252.jpg]'s death and that [a:Brandon Sanderson|38550|Brandon Sanderson|http://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1201547425p2/38550.jpg] was going to complete the series that it was on my radar again. I wasn't familiar with Mr. Sanderson, but it reminded me that I wanted to read this series.<br/><br/>I still wasn't much of a reader. I always was reading something, but the time I spent was few and far between. It took me about a year and a half to read all the books through [b:The Gathering Storm|1166599|The Gathering Storm (Wheel of Time, #12; A Memory of Light, #1)|Robert Jordan|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1312064325s/1166599.jpg|1920889]. I didn't have long to wait for [b:Towers of Midnight|8253920|Towers of Midnight (Wheel of Time, #13; A Memory of Light, #2)|Robert Jordan|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1358109459s/8253920.jpg|7338128] by the time I was caught up. The only real waiting I had to do was 14 months or so between that book and this one.<br/><br/>So I can't tell you what's it was like to wait one decade or two. I can't tell you what it was like to see Mr. Jordan die and dread the notion that a series you loved would never be complete. I had a nearly similar experience with [a:Stephen King|3389|Stephen King|http://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p2/3389.jpg] and the Dark Tower, but thankfully he finished that series and has gone on to continue writing.<br/><br/>This series is largely responsible for getting me back into reading more. Some friends on mine started reading it not long after I did, and I enjoyed talking about it with them. One of them hit the middle books and gave up, the other pressed on, but hasn't read this one yet.<br/><br/>The middle books of this series are why I stopped recommending this series to people/warned people who asked me about it. It's not a perfect series from start to end. But I love these characters. I love the world Mr. Jordan created. I wanted to know what would become of them, my friends.<br/><br/>I read this book far faster than I would have when I started this journey maybe 4 years ago, and a large part of that is thanks to this series.<br/><br/>Endings are always a tough thing. Especially for long series where the audience has invested a large amount of their time. Not everyone will be happy. I've read some complaints that not everything was resolved, or that their are lingering questions that spoiled it for them. Personally, I loved the ending, but I won't say anymore than that here.<br/><br/>I close with the words Mr. Jordan did:<br/><spoiler><i>This wind, it was not the ending. There are no endings, to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was an ending.</i></spoiler>",,Signed by Brandon Sanderson and Harriet  McDougal.,2,,,0,,,,,

It's been a few years now since I read most of the books and details are starting to escape me. Luckily like most books this is largely stand alone. <br/><br/>Mr. Sullivan tries to make all of his Riyria books readable without doing them all. Of course I still recommend against it. In fact if nothing else this book further makes me want to do a reread so I can refresh myself on some of the important details that show up as easter eggs/rewards to longtime Riyria readers.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the character of Ginny (aka the Winter's Daughter). I also really enjoyed the old window that they rented a room from. In general though, I thought that all of the supporting characters were pretty good.<br/><br/>I thought the banter of Royce and Handrian were as good as usual, and I liked their interplay with some of the others as well. It's one of the things that makes these books so much fun. <br/><br/>Despite a slower start, this book had a really good place at the end, including a pretty cool battle scene that was unlike anything in the previous books.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a decent addition to the Riyria cannon, though far from my favorite.

I was initially upset about it, but as the book went on I see why they did it. In order to tell the story they wanted to without dragging things out, it was necessary. I do hope they decide to do some extra books/novellas that covers some of that time. <br/><br/>Bobbie is one of my favorite characters, so I was really happy she was one of the main POVs in this book. I didn't think it was possible to lover her more, but she proved me wrong with this book. I thought Singh made for an interesting antagonist, but was my least favorite POV. Drummer was mostly fine. There is one particular detail that made me enjoy her chapters more than I might have otherwise. Holden is still Holden. <br/><br/>I thought the start of this book was a bit slow. It's possible a lot of it was my shock at the time jump and wondering what might have happened to characters I loved in that time. It might just be that the two new POV characters didn't really pull me into their stories as much. As the book went on however things really picked up.<br/><br/>This book does a lot to set up the final two books. I think that combined with the slower start made this book not quite as good as the last two for me. It was still a really enjoyable book though, and now I have to eagerly wait for the next book to see what happens next.",,,1,,,1,2017/12/05,Audible,Like new,,

It sounded like an interesting mix of Sci-Fi and Fantasy. I was thinking maybe something along the lines of Star Wars.<br/><br/>This book may as well have been straight fantasy however. There is very little science to speak of. Apparently humans have settled another planet and found a way to harness it and some of the creatures who live there as a form of magic. Technology as we know it seems pretty non-existent.<br/><br/>After a pretty intense and interesting prologue, I found the early parts of this book quite slow. Things did pick up later, but then I'd find myself growing distracted/uninterested in what was going on. This made for a very uneven pace to the story. That may be in part due to my general dislike of most of the characters. <br/><br/>The book describes Damian as a warrior, but in truth he's a paladin. When paladins aren't off heroically saving people in need, they seem to spend their time judging everyone else who can't live up to their lofty standards. Damian isn't quite this bad, but he does have his moments.<br/><br/>I initially was the most interested in Cianni, but her character development throughout this book was not to my liking. Her assistant mostly got on my nerves.<br/><br/>The most interesting character was the Hunter, but he's was very hard to like for many of the same reasons that made him interesting.<br/><br/>I'm very much a fan of character-driven story, so when I don't connect well with the characters, it almost always hurts my enjoyment of the book.<br/><br/>The world building, and the magic systems were both pretty interesting. They felt pretty unique from most fantasy I've read, and that's always hard to do.<br/><br/>Overall I felt like the pacing issues and my general dislike of the characters cost this book at least a star, possibly more. A strong ending and interesting world building helped to make up for things.<br/><br/>I'm still unsure if I'll continue on with the series. The ending has peaked my interest to know what comes next, but for now I'm not going to be rushing out to pick up the second book.",,,1,,,1,2017/08/27,,Like new,,

The characters and creatures are a lot of fun, and Alice is a great protagonist.

They were all fine, but as far as heist crews, they were far less memorable than those from <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/series/43531-gentleman-bastard"">Gentleman Bastards</a> or <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/series/131836-six-of-crows"">Six of Crows</a>.<br/><br/>I am a sucker for a fantasy heist story though. This was fun enough, and sets up some interesting things for future books, but just not as good as some of the aforementioned series.<br/><br/>The magic system is one of the most interesting/unique/disgusting ones I've come across. Eating things to gain magic isn't a new idea, but bones? Yeah, no thanks. I'll stay a Muggle.<br/><br/>Overall this was enjoyable enough that I'll pick up the next book in the series to see where it goes next, but I won't be rushing out to read it right away.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

There was a time a few years ago when Brandon Sanderson could do no wrong. I read everything he put out and loved it all. Eventually that streak ended, but his cosmere books are still quite enjoyable. None more so than Stormlight Archive.<br/><br/>I had a rough start to this one. I held off on reading the free chapters posted on tor.com because I didn't want to have to read it in short increments. This is a beefy book (longest yet) but I knew I'd want to tear right through. Unfortunately, the post office had other plans and I got a later start on this than I planned. I rationed the free chapters (thankfully there were a lot of those!) out for 4 long days waiting on a replacement copy to be delivered.<br/><br/>Once I got my book, all other hobbies were set aside and I spent more time reading in the last week than I probably did in the last 4-5 months. I was averaging about 75 pages a day (a lot for me) while I had work, and closer to 200 pages on my days off. Add in a 4-day holiday weekend and I was in bliss! I had planned to finish the book by today, and I guess technically that is true as I ended up reading 300+ pages well into the night to finish this off.<br/><br/>If you've read the first two books of the series, you'll know that Mr. Sanderson focuses on one character. That isn't to say the others don't play a role, but we get the most of this focus character, typically in the form of additional flashback chapters that offer us additional insight. In [b:The Way of Kings|7235533|The Way of Kings (The Stormlight Archive, #1)|Brandon Sanderson|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1507307887s/7235533.jpg|8134945] it's Kaladin, in [b:Words of Radiance|17332218|Words of Radiance (The Stormlight Archive, #2)|Brandon Sanderson|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1507307927s/17332218.jpg|16482835] it was Shallan. This book belongs to Dalinar.<br/><br/>We learn a lot important details, not only about Dalinar, but Roshar as well. Mr. Sanderson continues his excellent world building and further expands his magic system (albeit maybe not as much as in some of the previous entries).<br/><br/>There is a still a lot of focus on Kaladin, Shallan and Andolin too, but we also get some really great insights into many of the secondary characters, in particular the Bridge 4 crew. Those chapters were probably some of my favorites. There are a few other parts/characters in this I really enjoyed as well, but I don't want to give anything away.<br/><br/>This book is massive, and you get a lot of story for your money. I found some of the early going a bit slower than previous books, but the final section of book was so fast paced, I lost all track of time and happily stayed up well past the time I normally go to bed just so I could finish.<br/><br/>Part of me wishes I had more self control to read this slower. It will now be a few more years until we get the next volume of this series and I'm back to waiting. The rest of me is ecstatic to once again have another book so good as to remind me why I love to read and why this continues to be my favorite series. So far Mr. Sanderson is 3/3 on perfect scores. I can't wait to see what he has in store for us next.",,,1,,,1,2017/11/14,Amazon,Like new,,

I really enjoyed this series, and I was really bummed when it stopped. Or became a web-comic. Or something. I don't know, I found it all very confusing.<br/><br/>The entry is a bit of a reboot/fresh start with a new artist on board. I think it's been dubbed ""Volume 2"". It takes place some time after the events of the first 15 issues, so it's not like that story was thrown away, but I felt like there was a lot more there we never got (or least not in the trades that have been put out).<br/><br/>The stories here mostly felt like stand alone, but it seems that he's laying the groundwork for a larger story to come. Either way much like the previous volumes, this volume was a lot of fun, just not quite as good as the previous ones.<br/><br/>Betty continues to be my favorite of the Queens, but they are all a lot of fun in their own ways. I think that Braga adds a nice element to the group dynamic as well.<br/><br/>I hope we get some larger story in the next volume, but for now it's just nice to get more Rat Queens!<br/><br/><b><u>Artwork</u></b><br/>Owen Gieni does a fine job with the artwork, but I'm not blown away. The queens look like themselves, and he seemed to do a good job visualizing the story Mr. Wiebe wants to tell.

I'd recommend the audio as a good option for this book, and I'd definitely listen to another book she narrated.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I'll admit I bought this book without ever reading even the blurb.

How do you follow up on something so successful? The answer for me is a bit mixed, but mostly positive.<br/><br/>Artemis is awesome. Though I don't mean the book. I mean the place in the book. Andy Weir did a fantastic job creating it. Almost too good of a job. I kind of made the story he set in it a bit underwhelming. I really want to visit the place (though since I have trouble riding many amusement park rides, I don't see how I'd ever actually make it to the moon; Maybe they could knock me out first?).<br/><br/>The main character is pretty well written. She's smart, capable, and quite a bit sneaky. The supporting characters are interesting and flushed out enough to feel well developed if we were to dig a bit deeper, even though we never do. I also liked the way we get the Jazz's backstory through a series of emails with someone back on earth.<br/><br/>So if you've got an amazing setting and a pretty well written main character, why the mixed thoughts? Well the story itself wasn't all that interesting/unique. You could have (mostly) set this book on Earth and most of the plot points wouldn't have really changed.<br/><br/>It just felt like this awesome world building he done was mostly wasted. Of course things would have to play out differently on Earth. You couldn't have moon walks or low gravity, but the ""loveable criminal with her own set of morals"" has been done to death.<br/><br/>Overall I'm glad I picked this one up, and I'll totally buy Mr. Weir's next novel without reading the blurb again. I really enjoy the way he mixes in science without making the book feel ""too hard sci-fi"". I kind of want a sequel (or maybe a prequel?) to this book where we just get more awesome stuff with Artemis. It really was the star of this book.",,,1,,,1,2017/11/15,Audible,Like new,,

I suspect it was maybe a 2.5 rounded down but it's hard to say at this point. The audio book is 41 hours long, and the prologue makes up over 3 hours of that. That's over 7% of the book. I think it helps to highlight some of the pacing issues I have with this book.<br/><br/>We are introduced to entirely too many new characters and POVs for me to keep them all straight in my head. Finally Perrin shows up in the prologue after being absent in the last book, only to not show up again until the final third or so.<br/><br/>That said, I was never bored by this one. I think part of that is because it was a reread so I was picking up stuff I missed the first time, and I'm more attached the the characters who are sometimes annoying here than I was on my original read.<br/><br/>There is entirely too much setup and moving things around. I feel like this book could be about 25% shorter and not lose too much. This is epic fantasy, so of course there is going to be more detail and world building than your typical book, but I question what a lot of the early parts really add to the narrative.<br/><br/>The last third of this book does help to make up for a lot though. The pacing gets much better, and the scale of plot developments is massive. These aren't tiny details lost to the history books. This is history in the making. The actions of the protagonists will be remembered for years to come. Assuming they can all survive the rise of the Dark One and his minions.<br/><br/>I'm a huge wheel of fan time, but it has flaws.

That changed in college. For several years after college, I didn't read much, but what I read tended to be Urban Fantasy. I just couldn't seem to get enough. My favorite is The Dresden Files.<br/><br/>Well at some point apparently I had enough. Every Urban Fantasy series I tried just didn't hold up to the later Dresden Files books, and I was no longer willing to give a series several books to hold my interest. I had pretty much given up on Urban Fantasy when I picked this series up.<br/><br/>I meant to read this book much sooner than I did, but other books kept coming up. Finally last month I had some extra time due to a road trip and I was looking for something fun/light to pass the time. This was the perfect book for that.<br/><br/>Urban Fantasy is littered with detectives/mysteries and this one is no different, but somehow Mr. Aaronvovitch does enough that I just don't care. I really like the characters, and I like the approach to magic. I want to know more about the world and the deeper mysteries of the Faceless Man that have been set up.<br/><br/>The main story of this book was fine, but not fantastic. It took a little while for things to get going, but the last 25% or so was all downhill. I would have liked it if we got more of the overarching plot. Dresden Files took a long time to set up it's larger story arcs, and I think that is much to its detriment. This feels much more like the TV episode format (continuing plot at beginning and end with the meat of it being mostly unrelated/stand alone). I hope we get more developments in the next book.<br/><br/>Peter and his partner are fun to follow around. The supporting cast was fine, but not super memorable. I liked the addition of the FBI agent (whose name I've already forgotten because I can't remember names ever). I don't know how they'd work her into a recurring role considering this is set in London, but I do hope this isn't the last we see of her.<br/><br/>This was a great road trip book, and I may pick up the next book when I hit the road again in December.",,,1,,,1,2017/10/26,Audible,Like new,,

Likely this is due to Disney saving it for one of the 500 movies they have in the works. <br/><br/>There are some good ties to some of the movies, but not enough for my liking. I think it would have been better pitched as simply a story that takes place in-between the two movies rather than a bridge.<br/><br/>I will say Mr. Wendig's original characters really grew on me. It's always tough to come into a series with such well known/loved characters and then proceed to create your own to tell a story. It definitely took awhile for me to warm up to them, but I liked them all by the end of this trilogy. I wouldn't mind seeing them show up again somewhere else.<br/><br/>Overall this was a decent series, but easily skippable. If you're looking for some extra Star Wars stories, there are probably some better options out there. If you're a fanatic and just have to read it all, this series was certainly enjoyable enough for me anyways.",,,1,,,1,2017/10/20,Audible,Like new,,

This one isn't quite the typical Stephenson book, possibly because he has a co-author. Much like some of his other books it's a blend of sci-fi, fantasy and historical fiction. <br/><br/>Unlike most of his other books, I didn't feel this one was prone to tangents. He does spend a fair bit of time early on explaining how time travel works, and how D.O.D.O was created however. I did find this part a bit slower than the second half. Maybe I just enjoying watching the world burn?<br/><br/>I've never read anything by Nicole Galland, and it's hard for me to pick out where she was writing. Maybe she kept him in check on the tangents? The history part did seem pretty well flushed out, and from what I've read that seems to be her area of expertise. The narrative style felt very much like any other Neal Stephenson book to me. I didn't seem to have quite the same sense of humor than I recall from other books however.<br/><br/>I thought the characters were quite good, especially the main two Melisande and Triston. With all the time travel we got a lot of interesting characters from various time periods too.<br/><br/>Another standard Stephenson trait of this book was the in-depth explanation of how Time Travel was possible. He did it with a bent to physics that seem plausible enough to me, but I've taken all of two semester of physics more years ago than I'd like to think about, so I'm sure physicists probably will roll their eyes at the whole thing.<br/><br/>Like most Time Travel stories though, I think it's important to set up the rules in advance and stick to them, otherwise things can go way off the rails. I feel like they did a good job there.<br/><br/>Things ended in a pretty good spot, but I'd happily pick up a second book if they decide to write one. There is definitely room for more story if the want to tell it.<br/><br/>If you enjoy Stephenson and time travel stories, I think this is a good pickup. Like me however, you may find the first half of this book harder to get through than the second half. I think there was enough of interest there for me to get to the ""good parts"" without growing bored. I'd say the first half was a solid 3 stars, while the second half was a solid 4, hence my overall 3.5 rating.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I hadn't exactly planned to listen to this one, but I had put a hold in for this awhile back because the wait list was pretty long. The timing on my hold worked out pretty well to fit this into my schedule.<br/><br/>When I was younger I probably read thrillers more than any other genre, but I never read and Tom Clancy apart from [b:Net Force|957376|Net Force (Tom Clancy's Net Force, #1)|Steve Perry|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388235806s/957376.jpg|2467543] (and in writing this review I discovered he didn't even write that). I had watched all the Jack Ryan movies however. I'm still working my way slowly through the entire series in publication order, and this one was up next. <br/><br/>It certainly doesn't have the name recognition of several of the other Jack Ryan books, but it was a fairly solid entry. I found it slow in the early going, and wasn't really getting into it. There were a few different subplots, including a random Afghani mujahideen whose name we never learn, and is simply referred to as the Archer. I had no idea how that was supposed to tie in with everything else going on.<br/><br/>As someone who was born in the 80's, I didn't learn about our involvement with helping the mujahideen, until much later. I must admit it seemed a bit strange to me reading this after we've been fighting in Afghanistan ourselves for so many years. That aside, it took quite some time for the relevance of Archer's storyline to fit into the larger picture.<br/><br/>Jack Ryan is once again at the center of the story, but one could argue not the most important character. That may be the titular character the Cardinal himself, or possibly one of the other players in Russia. That doesn't mean he isn't a key player, but there is a lot of time spent away from Jack and his actions in this one.<br/><br/>This book certainly had a lot more espionage than the previous books. I liked how Mr. Clancy presented both the American and Soviet sides. At times I felt he was a bit too eager to paint the Americans as lagging behind the Soviets. This isn't from any sense of superiority as an American, but simply that it felt like he was doing it try to ratchet up the stakes a bit too much. <br/><br/>In the end though, I thought it was a pretty well balanced, with people on both sides of the conflict who simply wished to avoid further escalation of conflict between the US and the Soviet Union. Both sides made mistakes, and both sides took advantage of their adversaries mistakes.<br/><br/>There wasn't a whole lot of action in this one. Most of the tension comes from the various spy plots. Don't get me wrong, there are still a few gunfights, explosions and a car chase, but I felt like they aren't as prevalent as other Jack Ryan stories.<br/><br/>I thought the end of the book really picked up the pacing, likely because the early part spent so much time moving the pieces into place and setting up the stakes of the book.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the book, but I didn't love it. I'm glad my library seems to have the whole series in digital audio now, so I can simply borrow these books rather than buying any more of them. I suspect most of them will be in the fun, but not spectacular category that I'd place this book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The story of Roland's coming of age in particular is one I could listen to again and again (and so I have, say thankee-sai).<br/><br/>Another particular favorite of mine is Tull. It gives us a glimpse, and it just a glimpse of who the Gunslinger really is. One of the revisions in the scene I'm not sure I agree with. <spoiler>In the original text Roland shoots Allie without her begging him for it.</spoiler> It's not a ""Han Shot First"" re-write for me, but one I felt un-necessary that tries to offer some forgiveness for Roland's actions.<br/><br/>That said. I love this book. The original book is actually a collection of  5 stories that were published in a magazine over the span of about 3 years. Mr. King revised the book in 2003. <br/><br/>For the most part, the revisions help to fill out the story and clear up some continuity issues that Mr. King hadn't worked out when he first wrote them. You could maybe call it ret-con, but I really consider it more of clarification of detail that was lacking.<br/><br/>I've always wondered why so many people don't like this book. My friend listened to it with his brother. He almost quit the series right there. His brother did. I've seen many people recommend skipping this book outright and coming back to it at the end. I suppose that would work, but the need for it is beyond my comprehension.<br/><br/>I thought maybe this re-read many years since my last around the time of the final 3 books release in the mid 2000s would shed some light on it.

I was expecting a bit more of a climax than we actually got.<br/><br/>That isn't to say I was disappointed. This was a fun series, and it's been pretty faced paced all the way though. While I'm fine with how things leave off at the end, I wouldn't mind if Mr. Taylor decided to revisit the Bobs later on with some kind of sequel, ideally set hundreds (or maybe thousands?) of years after this one wraps up.<br/><br/>Either way I'll have to keep an eye out for Mr. Taylor's next book and hope that it's as much fun as this series has been.",,,1,,,1,2017/08/24,Audible,Like new,,

I'm reluctant to say it was rushed, but I would have liked a bit more time on the final arc and a bit less time spent on the first.<br/><br/>This is one of those stories deep with meaning that I found quite apparent without being so blatant as to hit you over the head.

I've read two collections by him prior to this one: [b:Hearts in Atlantis|11602|Hearts in Atlantis|Stephen King|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1374048926s/11602.jpg|3166850] and [b:Different Seasons|39662|Different Seasons|Stephen King|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1329662611s/39662.jpg|2248680]. I thought both of them were stronger collections. The main difference is those contain fewer, but longer stories I think.<br/><br/>This one has been on my radar for a long time, in particular because of The Mist, which is the first (and longest) story. It's actually a Novella, where the rest are short stories. It's supposed to have ""major"" ties to his Dark Tower series, and one of the few in that category I haven't read already. Personally I found it being a ""major"" connection to be a stretch, especially compared with most of the others. So if like me, you're wanting to read all the associated works, I personally think you can skip this one without much issue.<br/><br/>There are 3 stories worth calling out for this collection of 22 (although calling 2 of them stories is overly generous). The best story was probably Mrs. Todd's Shortcut. I thought it was fantastic. I also really enjoyed The Monkey and Gramma.<br/><br/>Paranoid: A Chant and For Owen round out the bottom. I guess if you have little fragments of writing you think are interesting, sticking them in such a large collection is the best way to publish them, but I think the collection would have been stronger without them personally. <br/><br/>As to the rest you can consult my list of ratings below.<br/><br/><b><u>Audio</u></b><br/>This book has 13 unique narrators, some of them reading several stories.

Not just the ""main"" characters like Persephone and Suri, but the ""minor"" ones like Brin and especially Roan. <br/><br/>On the men's side, I find most of them pretty unlikable, especially the elves. Raithe, who I found to be a pretty great character in the first book, annoyed me for much of this book.

Generally I find music in audiobooks distracting, but the Star Wars books always do it right, and make any book narrated by Mr. Thompson a must listen for me.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I always loved the Star Wars movies as a kid, but I was never a big enough fan to jump into the Expanded Universe (Legends) books until I was much older. Shortly after I did, Disney bought Lucas and it made all of that stuff non-canon. The one series I did read, was the one that everyone seemed to recommend the most: The Thrawn trilogy.<br/><br/>I enjoyed that trilogy, especially in audio. Often dubbed the third trilogy, it was a pretty good attempt to tell a bit story after the end of Return of the Jedi. I enjoyed those books, but I didn't love them. The main antagonist however, was fantastic. Thrawn made for a very different character than the emperor and Vadar. I also found Mara Jade another excellent character. Timothy Zahn's contribution to Star Wars was substantial. It was a shame to see those characters suddenly be relegated to ""Legends"". I understand why they did it though.<br/><br/>Fast forward a few years, and when I saw the announcement that Thrawn was being added back into the canon again, first on the excellent Star Wars Rebels show, and later with a new book written by Timothy Zahn and I was really excited.<br/><br/>I don't remember a whole lot about the original Thrawn series beyond the characteristics of Thrawn himself. Most of the other characters and plot details are hazy at best. What is fresh however is his appearance on Rebels. This book serves as a backstory of sorts. How Grand Admiral Thrawn came to be such a highly ranked member of the Imperial Fleet.<br/><br/>You get a lot more insight into his thinking. At times I found that a bit tedious, especially the parts where he was observing people's facial movements in order to evaluate what they were thinking. However as the book went on that seemed to be a bit less frequent, or maybe I just finally got used to it. <br/><br/>The character is so well done, that I found myself rooting for him to outmaneuver everyone he went up against, and forgot that he was working for the Empire. He's certainly not the villain in this book that he was in the original trilogy, or that he's portrayed on the Rebels show. It probably helps that none of the usual heroes are present to oppose him. Much of his issue stems from the empire itself. I enjoyed getting this kind of view of the character.<br/><br/>The secondary characters were quite good as well. Not quite to the standards of the original series, but memorable nonetheless. Eli Vanto is definitely a new favorite, and I hope we get more stories about him in addition to Thrawn. Marinda Price was another interesting character, who despite being a secondary character, got quite a lot of character development. <br/><br/>Originally I was wondering what her story had to do with the plot, and I found the early parts of her sections slow. Eventually though her story got more interesting, and its relevance was revealed.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this was a really enjoyable addition, and I hope that it's only the start, because while we got a lot of interesting backstory on Thrawn, I found myself with a lot more questions than answers. I especially want to see where this fits in with the final season of the Rebels show.",,,1,,,1,2017/04/15,Audible,Like new,,

I've found most of his non-Magic books to be not as good, and this one isn't different. However I think this is my favorite of his non-Magic 2.0 books.<br/><br/>One of the things that first attracted me to his books was that I'm a computer programmer. This book hits on some of those same aspects for me. I just didn't find it as funny. I listened to 70% of this in one sitting while driving back from my cousin's wedding and it helped to pass the time quite nicely.<br/><br/>The idea of artificial intelligence is both fascinating to me, and a little bit terrifying. And what's worse than an AI out of control? An AI with the mentality of a 6 year old child. But really this book isn't some kind of warning for a potential apocalypse of our own making. It's more of a commentary on our own insecurities and shortcomings. It's not as funny as his other stuff, but he does keep things pretty light throughout.<br/><br/>Much like Martin, I found Hope a bit unlikeable at times. However unlike Martin (from Magic 2.0), she's not an idiot. She just could stand to think a bit more before she speaks sometimes. Something I know I can identify with.

In fact his story is now where I thought it was going to be a few books ago. Perrin was my favorite character for most of the early books on my original read, and this book finally brings his storyline back to a really enjoyable place for me.<br/><br/>The other major, highlight was Mat's story. Mat became my favorite later on in the series, and has remained so throughout my entire reread. I've been eagerly awaiting the events of this book since I first started my reread a year ago.<br/><br/>But Mat and Perrin weren't all I enjoyed here. First there is Lan, whose long been a favorite secondary character, who gets an opportunity to shine here. In addition I found much of Egwayne and Rand's stories enjoyable.<br/><br/>The parts that dragged more for me where anything to do with Elayne or her brothers. Gawyn especially, but Galad isn't much better. I still find them all pretty insufferable, even when they are doing remarkable things.<br/><br/>Overall this is a pretty solid entry and sets things up nicely for the final book.

It's one of those rare books that I keep thinking about even when I'm not reading it.<br/><br/>This book does a pretty good job further exploring the ideas introduced in the first book and setting the stage for the final book while managing not to suffer from ""middle book syndrome"".<br/><br/>The characters are once again interesting and conflicted. The ideas presented here are not black and white. That's largely the reason I think this book sticks with you even after you put it down.<br/><br/>I like that despite the fact that there are some pretty scary things that could occur if such a thing were possible, Mr. Naam makes it a point to explore some of the positive as well. That more the feasibility of the technology makes this book feel more realistic. There are good people out there. I'd like to hope more good than bad. People would use this technology for the betterment of humanity just as they would use it as a means to gain power, wealth or any other thing they might desire.<br/><br/>Much like the last book, my main complaint is that the negative side effects of the drug seemed to be mostly ignored in favor of abuses it allows humanity to do to one another. He does explore the addiction aspect a little bit. However that seems to be something that the drug/technology enables you to do, rather than an effect of its use.<br/><br/>Overall this is as enjoyable as the first. I hate to use a term like ""more of the same"" because that has a negative connotation to it.

So this is where I had to join the fans in waiting for an end. Hardly a comparison to fans who have been reading this series since the beginning.<br/><br/>This is the book that turned me into a rabid Brandon Sanderson fan, and I proceeded to consume nearly every book he had written to this point. I feel that Mr. Jordan had finally returned to form with [b:Knife of Dreams|13888|Knife of Dreams (Wheel of Time, #11)|Robert Jordan|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1397856387s/13888.jpg|987750], so it's not much of a surprise that this book moves at a much faster pace than some of the previous ones.<br/><br/>For me the clear star of the book is Egwene. At first glance it might be easy to give Mr. Sanderson credit for making her into an awesome character, but in my opinion this book is simply the fulfillment of path Mr. Jordan setup in the last few novels of the series. Her chapters were always by far the most interesting parts, even over my those of my favorite character Mat's chapters.<br/><br/>I remember reading a lot of criticism from fans that Mr. Sanderson didn't do a good job with Mat, and that he changed a lot from the way Mr. Jordan wrote him. During my first reading of the series I didn't agree. After a second reading however, I am inclined to agree somewhat. Mat did feel a bit off. I almost want to say a bit ""goofy"" compared to the previous few books. However, I still enjoyed his parts quite a lot, and I'm definitely looking forward to what I know is yet to come for him in the final two books.<br/><br/>I don't remember being so annoyed at Rand this late in the series as I was during this reread. I think that's part of why I didn't enjoy this book quite as much as I remember. I don't put that on Mr. Sanderson however. <br/><br/>Much like Perrin (who annoyed me even more even though his part is quite small), Rand is at a point in his story to be very unlikable. Mr. Sanderson must write the characters forward to their conclusion in a way that follows with everything that's going on.<br/><br/>Both are dealing with a lot of baggage. I think I just have less tolerance for it than I did during my first read. Especially after how great Egwene (and to a lesser degree Nynaeve's parts) are. <br/><br/>Overall things are finally moving towards a resolution, and even though I know what's coming I can't wait to read it all again.",,,2,,,1,2017/06/10,Audible,Like new,,

Solomon Kane wields daggers, pistols a sword, and in later stories, a magical staff. Sounds like it would be great!<br/><br/>Unfortunately I was mostly bored. The best story of the bunch for me was The Children of Asshur, which was only a fragment and therefore ends somewhat abruptly.

I enjoyed it, more than his two non-series books, but not quite as much as the other books in the series. Part of why I love this series is how it blends fantasy with computer programming and gaming. While the main premise is based on a coding mistake, most of the focus was on dealing with the problem, and there just felt like less of the computer/gaming stuff than previous volumes.<br/><br/>This book focused more on some non-wizard characters too.

I don't give out 5 stars easily, and normally when I do it's a no-brainer. This one not so much. The book has some pacing issues, especially early on. I have no idea of the final page count, but in audio it's nearly 40 hours long.  Ms. Hobb's books have always been on the slower side, but there were points in this book where it was a bit too much. That's only a minor gripe though.<br/><br/>FitzChivarly Farseer is one of the most real character I ever read. When this series was announced I was both excited and nervous to get to spend more time with him. What terrible things would Ms. Hobb do to him this time?

However my desire to spend time with him again outweighed my fear.<br/><br/>When the series started, I was not happy about the addition of Bee's chapters. At its conclusion, I'm still a bit torn on them, but I think the story could not have been told otherwise. I think part of me was just irritated to have to spend any time in the book away from Fitz.

Joy, anger, love, hate, cheer, sorrow. I feel so much that I'm drained. Few books do that to me, but hers seem to do it all the time, especially the Fitz books.

At first I thought it was a flashback novel with how Vorkosigan came to be where he was in the first book, only to realize that no, I was reading a book set several years later about his son. Oops.<br/><br/>The physical issues Miles has, make him an interesting character amidst a world that values strength and proficiency at war. Of course he's only half Barrayan, which also puts him apart from his peers as well. I'm always drawn to characters who outthink their opponents rather than simply through superior force.<br/><br/>I believe that much of the series focuses on Miles, which makes me happy because he is by far the character I'm most interested so far. I am however interested in revisiting his parents down the road as well.

I did struggle a bit in the beginning with the whole ""Wrongfully accused Fugitive"" trope. It felt too generic for me, and I found myself starting to grow bored.<br/><br/>However once things got past the setup, I found that the sci-fi elements that Mr. Suarez added in made his spin on the story unique enough to be quite enjoyable. As with most of his books, things start of in the realm of believability and end up veering into the realm of ridiculousness at times. <br/><br/>I sometimes struggled with Kenneth Durand as a protagonist, but overall I thought his story does a good job of posing interesting questions about how much of who we are is biology vs. our upbringing. The whole nurture vs. nature debate. The book as a whole brings up some interesting ideas of what should be allowed and what should be illegal in terms of biological engineering.<br/><br/>I don't pretend to have the same level of comprehension about biology and what's possible in that field as I do in computers, but some parts of the story were just a bit too much for me to not to roll my eyes.

There are fantastical elements, but they aren't always there.<br/><br/>To me, most of the fantasy elements were simply there to serve as a framing device to connect three different stories. Jeanne in France, Mer in Haiti and Meritet in Egypt. Of the three, I enjoyed Meritet the best. It's a shame she doesn't enter the book until much later, I might have been hooked a bit sooner.<br/><br/>I will say that despite never warming up to Jeanne, I did warm up to her story somewhat. Mer's story was probably the hardest to read, but they were all tough. This book can be graphic quite frequently.

I love Sci-Fi, but I tend to prefer Space Opera or Space Fantasy to nearly anything else. I also have a pretty bad track record with older Sci-Fi.<br/><br/>This book has won a lot (all?) of awards. That often doesn't mean much to me with regards to how much I like it. Some books I love wouldn't even sniff a nomination. Some award winning books I've been very bored by. This one fell somewhere in between. I enjoyed it, but it's not going to be something I rush out and recommend to others.<br/><br/>I was also a bit concerned because it was published 40 years ago. It definitely shows it's age at certain points. For me that was less about the science that may not hold up than it is about the social things. In particular the attitudes towards domestic abuse. However I guess for a book written in the 1970s, the attitude toward homosexuality while not exactly great, seemed far more progressive than I would have expected. Still the parts dealing with these things definitely pulled me out of the story.<br/><br/>At the start of the book I wasn't thrilled by the framing device. Our protagonist is seeing a robot psychiatrist and discussing his issues of guilt. Through this we learn what happened to him and about the place they call Gateway. As the book went on however, I warmed up to this device, and found it a pretty good mechanism for ""info-dumping"" to the reader.<br/><br/>I struggled to like the protagonist, especially later in the story, but I found his journey fairly enjoyable. I probably would have given this book another half of a star had I liked him better.<br/><br/>It's my understanding that this was originally conceived as a stand alone novel, and only after it was so successful was it expanded into a series. I'm content to stop here.

I didn't listen to this since I had previously read it on tor.com, but if you haven't, I'd recommend you skip ahead (Chapter 27 I believe) to listen to it first before jumping into the book itself as it gives you more background than the book itself does.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I think before last year I hadn't read a single book by John Scalzi. Before 2012 I hadn't even heard of him. Now he's one of my favorite writers and I've listened to just about everything he's written.<br/><br/>I tend to read more fantasy than sci-fi. I seem to prefer my sci-fi in TV/movie form instead. Maybe because I like lighter sci-fi, which Mr. Scalzi writes very well. I also love his snarky sense of humor which I think Wil Wheaton does well.<br/><br/>This might be my favorite book of his yet. It's not as funny as some of his others, but it's still a lot of fun. I really love the world he built with some hand wavy science fiction that is really just used to set the stage for a murder mystery. He said that he's got an idea for another book in this world if it does well, so everyone go out and buy a copy because I want him to write it!<br/><br/>Our protagonist Chris is a rookie FBI agent on their first week with one major difference. They are ""Locked-In"" to their body since childhood due to a global pandemic. Chris uses a remote controlled robot nicknamed a Threep (after C-3PO) to be present in the world due to being unable to speak or move.<br/><br/>Writing the previous paragraph was very difficult because I wanted to keep it gender neutral. Because this entire book is as far as I can tell written that way. Mr. Scalzi probably had an easier time of it than I did because 1) He's an experienced and professional writer and 2) It's written in first person. Still it's an interesting approach to a story.<br/><br/>Since I did the Wil Wheaton version (and because I'm a guy myself), I assumed Chris to be a guy, only to realize we never really know if that's true or not.<br/><br/>It goes to show that for all the emphasis on racial and gender differences it really doesn't matter when telling a good story. When your protagonist is interacting with everyone remotely with a robot what does gender or race matter? They look like a robot. Chris is a capable FBI agent because of their mind, because when you're Locked-In that's really all that matters.<br/><br/>This is another fun and quick read from a master of writing those kinds of stories.

I didn't really care for the prequel movies, and the show was aimed at kids, so it was bound to be bad, right? Apparently not. While not every episode is a classic, the series as a whole was quite great, and one of the reasons was Ahsoka Tano. <br/><br/>It being a kid's show, they obviously wanted someone that kids could identify with, and Anakin Skywalker is no longer a Padawan. Enter Ahsoka Tano. I didn't love her right away, but she grew to become one of my favorite characters in Star Wars canon, and that's saying a lot.<br/><br/>When Disney bought Lucas, they invalidated most of the EU as ""Legends"", but kept the Clone Wars show as cannon. Unfortunately, since the show aired on Cartoon Network, it was quickly cancelled in favor of a new show on a Disney owned network, leaving Ahsoka's story not only incomplete, but left off in a pretty awful place.<br/><br/>This book takes place after Clone Wars, and before the new show Rebels. It's a bit on the short side and I found the start a little meandering. However once things get going it was a lot of fun, and provided most of the answers I was looking for. <br/><br/>If your a fan of the Star Wars TV shows, there is a lot to like here. If you haven't seen them, I'd suggest checking them out first before picking this one up. You really don't get a lot of backstory on Ahsoka, so it may be less appealing.<br/><br/>I've never read a book by E.K. Johnston, but I feel like she did a good job with the book. I'd love to see a sequel, further exploring her activities before the start of Rebels. Really, I just want more Ahsoka stories.

The start is a bit slow, but I was far from bored. There was a lot to setup with the start of a new series, even one in an already established world, but it was done quite well as usual.<br/><br/>Mr. Sullivan's books have become my go to recommendation the last few years, because I rarely feel so good while/after reading a book. He seems to always strike the right balance between tension and fun. I know I can pick up his books without worry about constant bloodbaths, backstabbing and despicable characters. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy darker fantasy as well, but it's nice to read something on the lighter side.<br/><br/>I've been looking forward to picking this series up since first learning about it a few years back. I love his Riyria books largely due to the characters he's created. What would a series set in the same world but 3000 years in the past hold in store?<br/><br/>The answer should be unsurprising to fans of his work. Mr. Sullivan has once again created a cast of excellent characters who I can't help but love. Since I did the audio you'll have to forgive any misspellings on my part. Hands down my favorite of the bunch was Suri, whose bafflement of ""the game"" everyone plays of stating obvious things is only part of the reason she's so endearing.<br/><br/>A close second is probably Persephone. She's smart and capable, and cares a great deal about her village and its inhabitants. It's also nice to get the perspective of at least one of the Fhrey with Arion. So unlike many fantasy books that seem to relegate women to minor or unimportant characters, all of my favorites here are women.<br/><br/>Then there are Raithe and Malcolm, who make for a nearly as amusing pair as Royce and Hadrian. However not quite THAT good. And that doesn't get into all the excellent secondary and tertiary characters. Persephone's village is full of very interesting people who I look forward to seeing again in future novels.<br/><br/>All and all this book does a great job of setting up the story and introducing us to an excellent characters without ever feeling boring or full of info-dumps. It's also fairly well self-contained despite being the start of what looks to be a six book series. Things come to a good stopping place, while leaving your eager for what will come next.

I thought it was well done. <br/><br/>Every chapter/PoV felt like a good addition to the story. Many of the PoV's are one-offs, and a few of them are only a handful of chapters, while Holden and two other characters (Pa and Filip) have a large number of chapters throughout. I'll be curious to see if they keep to this format in future books of if this one was a special exception. I typically prefer a smaller (~4) number of PoVs.<br/><br/>I often have a hard time deciding between a really good book (4-4.5 stars) and a really great book (5). I don't have a hard and fast criteria. The one sure fire sign is when I hate to put a book down and make excuses to read/listen longer each day. This book was definitely that. On the very first day I had to make time to squeeze in a few extra chapters because I hit a ""no way I can stop here"" moment.<br/><br/>The characters in this series are excellent. Avasarala continues to be my favorite, but I love the entire crew of the Rocinate, and Bobbie Draper nearly as much. The main antagonist in the book Marco Inaros can feel a bit 1 dimensional at times, but he still feels very real to me too. His motivations and actions make sense. He never feels like he's doing things simply for the sake of a good story. He's just a bit single minded.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed this book, albeit slightly less than [b:Nemesis Games|22886612|Nemesis Games (Expanse, #5)|James S.A.

It's probably a bit more literary than I normally read, but when the story is good, that's what matters to me the most. So I read it one chapter here, another chapter there.

He always has, and he always will. Yes Steve Jobs was an incredible salesman with a great eye for where technology was heading, but without the incredible product that was the Apple II (and later other products like the iPod and iPhone made possible largely due to Jonathan Ive among others) Apple wouldn't be the brand it is today. It took both Steves to make Apple a success in those early days.<br/><br/>So I can understand why Steve Wozniak would want a book  giving his account of things.

Nothing like my dislike of the person Steve Jobs seems to have been, but it's hard to find your heroes aren't quite who you think they are.<br/><br/>The best part of this book for me was all the stuff on the creation of Apple and the early designs for the Apple I and II. He gets into a bit more technical detail than I would have expected, but not so much as to turn this into a technical manual.<br/><br/>The final chapter was pretty interesting too, where he offers his advice on how to turn your ideas into reality and success. I'm not sure I agree with all of his opinions, but then who am I to disagree?

Was I outgrowing Mr. Sanderson? Was his breakneck output finally showing in the quality of his books? Other Sanderson fans seems to disagree with me about [b:Shadows of Self|16065004|Shadows of Self (Mistborn, #5)|Brandon Sanderson|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1435053013s/16065004.jpg|21855448], so I was really apprehensive I was outgrowing him.<br/><br/>After reading this book, I think the answer is a little of both. I'm probably less forgiving than I was, and likely much less forgiving than many Sanderson fans. When this book <a href=""http://brandonsanderson.com/state-of-the-sanderson-december-2014/"">was announced</a>, Mr. Sanderson admitted to struggling with the previous one:<br/><br/><i>""jumping into Shadows of Self was slow going, and I found it much easier to go write the sequel to refresh myself on the world and characters. That done, I was able to move back to Shadows of Self and finish it up.""</i><br/><br/>So personally, I think that struggle showed in the final product. This book however, is classic Sanderson. My worries have been alleviated for the most part. I really enjoyed this one. In fact it's now one of my favorites of the series, and I think the best Wax & Wayne book to date.<br/><br/>So why is that? Well for me it's largely because of Sterris. She's quickly become my favorite character. I often struggle with Mr. Sanderson's jokes in general. I consider it a weak point in his writing. The groan factor of his jokes for Wayne are a very close second to his jokes in the Reckoner series, and those are intentionally bad. Sterris had me cracking up though. I'm not sure if it's intentional or not. If so, then maybe Mr. Sanderson is simply better at subtle humor than outright jokes. Of course humor is always subjective. I've had people argue with me that they enjoy his humor. To each their own.<br/><br/>Mostly, I just love Sterris' character development as this series has gone on. I'm sure it has a lot to do with self-identification with some of her neurocies. Her constant planning, and making of lists are things I find myself doing a lot. Although, not nearly as detailed as she does. Either way, she's a great compliment for Wax.<br/><br/>Like all Mistborn books (and really Sanderson books in general), the magic system is top-notch. He once again finds new and interesting ways to use the magic while mostly staying within the bounds he's previously established. When he does cross those bounds, he does so in a way that feels like we're simply learning more details about magic we didn't know before, not that he's breaking rules. And of course the action is excellent. <br/><br/>Most of all though, he's building a really interesting story. Cool magic, fast-paced action and great characters are all well and good, but it was the mysteries of The Set and the Bands of Mourning that had me hating to stop listening, and were enough to finally motivate me to hook up my trainer so I could get an extra 30-45 minutes of audio in each day.<br/><br/>I'm really happy with this book. This book ends in a decent enough place at least. Things are set up nicely, without leaving you on a giant cliffhanger.

A ten-book, 10,000+ page series is really ambitious. It would be easy for things to go off the rails at any point along the way.

It wasn't nearly as forced or as groan worthy as some of his other books, but it did leave me rolling my eyes more than it had me laughing.<br/><br/>I have a hard time deciding exactly why I didn't like this as much as the past novels. I was always excited to pick it back up and listen, but I found my attention wandering at times. I think if I had to pick any one thing, it was all the religion stuff. <br/><br/>Normally I find mythology fascinating. Mr. Sanderson rewards the long time and careful readers with references back to past events and characters from the original trilogy. While I find the evolution of fact into myth and religion itself quite interesting, the frequent talk of it wore on me a little.<br/><br/>Overall though, this is a fun book with some great action that always shines when Mr. Sanderson uses the magic system he built in new and unique ways. I'm interested in seeing how its use continues to evolve as the technology does as well.<br/><br/>This book seems to do a good job of setting up the trilogy without feeling like it just stops. I have many questions and theories about what might happen next and I can't wait to get the next book to see where things go next.",,,1,,,1,2015/10/06,Audible,Like new,,

The first book I read by him was [b:The Gathering Storm|1166599|The Gathering Storm (Wheel of Time, #12; A Memory of Light, #1)|Robert Jordan|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1312064325s/1166599.jpg|1920889] and I loved that too.<br/><br/>I went on to check out his Mistborn series shortly after and loved those books. When this came out however, I held back. I didn't really want to jump into what he promised to be a maybe 10 book series. I wanted to wait for it to be done/nearly done.<br/><br/>Fast forward a few years, two more excellent Wheel of Time books by Mr. Sanderson, and there was suddenly a hole in my reading. <br/><br/>I got to meet him in February at a signing for [b:A Memory of Light|7743175|A Memory of Light (Wheel of Time, #14; A Memory of Light, #3)|Robert Jordan|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1336055749s/7743175.jpg|10558806] and I felt bad that I had nothing that was exclusively his to sign in hardcover. That pretty much settled it for me and I managed to find a new first edition copy of the book online.<br/><br/>There is a lot of world building in this book. That's to be expected from book one of what looks to be a long series. There is a lot of time jumping, especially at the beginning.<br/><br/>After the brief first scene ends, we jump 4500 years into the future. Then there is a short prolouge, where we meet a bad-ass (though reluctant) assassin named Szeth. Then it jumps another 5 or 6 years before the main story gets rolling.<br/><br/>As the story begins we meet Kaladin Stormblessed. No he's not a farm boy suddenly thrust on an unexpected adventure, he's a unit commander in the military. He's a little bit older (19) than your typical fantasy trope hero as well. <br/><br/>That isn't to say he doesn't suffer from any tropes, but he feels like a refreshingly original character. I also appreciated the way Mr. Sanderson introduces him to you, in what I can only assume to be a nod to the prototype fantasy protagonist.<br/><br/>Mr. Sanderson makes use of flash back chapters starting 9 years in the past and slowly moves them forward in time filling you on how Kaladin came to be where he was.<br/><br/>We are next introduced to Shallan, a young noble woman set out on a mission to save her family from ruin. I've seen complaints that her parts of the book are ""pointless"" to the plot of this book, but I disagree. <br/><br/>While she has no roll in the main plot, Mr. Sanderson is building out his world and some of the key players in it. By the end of this novel it's apparent just how important Shallan's story line will be.<br/><br/>The first and third books of this novel deal with these two characters. <br/><br/>Starting in the second book, and continuing in the fourth, we are introduced to Dalinar and his son Adolin the Uncle and cousin of the King of Alethkar respectively. <br/><br/>Their chapters replace Shallan's while Kaladin's continue on.<br/><br/>It becomes apparent early on that Kalodin story is on a collision course with Dalinar but the journey to get there was enjoyable. Not to mention that the events surrounding their meeting as just pure awesomeness.<br/><br/>The final book makes use of all the character perspectives, and sets things up for the next novel. This novel is not stand-alone by any means, but I knew that coming in. That said, I think Mr. Sanderson found a good stopping point to conclude on.<br/><br/>I now eagerly await [b:Words of Radiance|11543195|Words of Radiance (The Stormlight Archive, #2)|Brandon Sanderson|/assets/nocover/60x80.png|16482835], and I suspect the many other books to follow.",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

That probably added to my overall enjoyment. Many people were recommending having read this before Words of Radiance, but I found it fun to go the other way and look for things that related back to the book. I think it would probably work out pretty well whichever way you choose to go.<br/><br/>Lightsong was easily my favorite character. I found him very quotable if not always funny. The mercenaries were less so, but still lightened up the mood with Vivenna, who was by far my least favorite POV in the book. She did grow on me by the end, but early on I just found her annoying. <br/><br/>Siri was somewhere in the middle. She starts off naive and a bit annoying. However she's not dumb and as she starts to get her bearings I found myself enjoying her chapters more.<br/><br/>The magic system is another cool idea, though it seems underutilized here. We only learn a few things about it early on and seem to be hit over the head a bit with those details, while never really expanding our knowledge until much later in the book.<br/><br/>The world seems pretty well built out for such a stand alone book, and from the notes available about the book it’s apparent that Mr. Sanderson knows a lot more about the world than he’s including in the story. <br/><br/>He’s supposed to be planning an eventual sequel, and I will definitely be excited to read it when it comes out.

Things really ramped up further when Wayne was introduced. The pairing of Wax and Wayne is one I really enjoyed.<br/><br/>Wax reminds me a little of Roland Deschain from the Dark Tower series. Wayne reminded me a little bit of Sherlock Holmes simply for his frequent use of disguise and various voices/accents.<br/><br/>The main drawback for me was Marasi. I like her character in concept. A smart, resourceful women who is well studied on law and lawkeeping. The execution left a little to be desired for me however. I found her personality annoying. Vin got a little whiny at points in the original series, but I found that far less bothersome than the ""helpless noble"" persona Marasi has.<br/><br/>The book also slows down in the middle, but not for long. The antagonist is pretty well done, although a bit too much mustache twirly in place.<br/><br/>Most of the plot twists were pretty obvious to me ahead of time, but that doesn't matter. The characters, the magic system, and the action really sucked me into this book.<br/><br/>I especially liked the additions Mr. Sanderson added to his already great magic system. He introduced some pretty cool ideas by mixing Allomancy and Feruchemy to make ""Twinborn"". This is especially excellent with the addition of guns to mix making for some really fun action scenes.<br/><br/>Overall this was a really enjoyable book that I read at just the right time. I was in the mood for something fun and light and this fit the bill nicely. I hope Mr. Sanderson gives us more stories with Wax and Wayne sooner rather than later.",,,1,,,1,2014/02/04,Audible,Like new,,

It's one thing not to pull punches with children, but this is something else.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just too old or cynical. I also could have done without the mini-rant about religion.

And I certainly didn't want to have things toned down for me either.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Steelheart though. It's far from his best work, but I found it to be a fun story. I don't think this book was nearly as good. Mr. Sanderson cranks out books like no other author in Fantasy, and I think that's starting to show a bit here. Or maybe I just don't love everything he writes anymore.<br/><br/>I like the change of scenery here. New York is a big contrast to Chicago. I also like the addition of new characters, and new Epics to confront.<br/><br/>The main draw, as usual for a Sanderson novel, is the magic system. Or in this case, whatever it is that caused humans to turn into epics. We get some good development into the mystery of the Calamity and the nature of epics and their weaknesses. Mostly in the last third of the book.<br/><br/>I found David annoying for most of the book. And whiny and mopey. You know, a teenager. Or at least the stereotypical teenager.<br/><br/>I'm eager to read the next book and have the rest of my questions answered, but I hope that it's the final book. I'd much rather he focus on his Cosmere books instead. Give me Stormlight Archive and Mistborn over this any day.",,,1,,,1,2015/01/06,Amazon,unspecified,,

The ending was partially satisfying, but felt very rushed. Too much time was spent moving characters around and on a new subplot introduced in the last book. The big/final villain was nowhere to be seen for far too long. Some new ideas were introduced right at the end with little to no explanation. Plus one of the interesting new characters  was introduced and then gone without ever coming back to them.<br/><br/>And that doesn't even get to the protagonist. David went from relatable/likable in the first book, to annoying in second, and downright obnoxious in this one. I never liked the bad metaphor gag. I've long felt Mr. Sanderson doesn't do humor well. He's apparently worse at intentionally bad jokes. I took to skipping every metaphor I could as the book went on.<br/><br/>Overall, while I liked the idea of super powers turning people into super villains and the ""magic"" of their powers, the execution fell short for me. It's far from his best world building. I don't read much Young Adult. It's demographic that seems to be largely all over the place and hard to truly define. I think from now on I may avoid it entirely. <br/><br/>I'll certainly be avoiding any of Mr. Sanderson's non-Cosmere books for the foreseeable future.

It's a great book to share with your kids if they are old enough.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I enjoyed this book, though not as much as his others. It's a young adult book, and unlike some books I've read in that category felt like it the whole way through.<br/><br/>The book has great illustrations. I'd highly recommend getting the print or ebook copy over the audio. I guess the audio comes with an errata of the pictures, but I'd find that sort of hard to work in, especially considering I'm usually doing something else while listening to audiobooks. The illustrations aren't high art, but they certainly add a lot to the story.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of Sanderson books, there isn't a whole lot of world building. From a map in the front of the book and a little of the discussion, apparently the United States is a series of Islands united under what seems more like the Articles of Confederation rather than the US Constitution.<br/><br/>The main thing that binds neighboring islands together are the academies where children are sent to learn how to be Rithmatists. Rithmatists are being trained to fight in a war in the center of the country against wild creatures that populated the country prior to the Europeans arrival. <br/><br/>There is some sort of federal jurisdiction, akin to maybe the FBI of sorts, but for the most part each island seems to keep to itself. The book is set in the early 1900s and has a bit of a Steampunk feel to it.<br/><br/>That's about all I could gather from the entire book. I'm sure he will flesh things out more as the series goes on.<br/><br/>As is the norm for a Brandon Sanderson novel, this series has an interesting and pretty unique magic system. Not as good as some of his others, but still interesting. Everything is based on drawing with chalk. Fans of Real-Time Strategy games will find the combat system familar. <br/><br/>You build your defenses, a base if you will, and there are various attacks you can do, including creating an army of chalkings to either attack or defend.<br/><br/>The protagonist is a 15 year old boy named Joel, whose mother works as a cleaning lady at the academy, where only Rithmatists and the richest non-Rithmatists can normally attend. He wants nothing more than to be a Rithmatist, but he was not chosen to be one.<br/><br/>Students begin to disappear, the Feds show up and one of the professors is tasked by the university to help figure out what is going on. Joel manages to get himself assigned to help in the hopes of learning more about Rithmancy that is normally kept from the non Rithmatists.<br/><br/>The story is decent, the writing is good, the characters are interesting, if a little cookie-cutter. The world building could have been a little better, even in a shorter young-adult novel. He does a bit at the end of the novel, but it is mostly setup for an inevitable sequel.<br/><br/>I was originally under the impression that this was a stand-alone story. I'm not sure if that was incorrect, or if it changed. I feel like the last few chapters could have been dropped with little detriment to the overall story and left it as stand alone.<br/><br/>That said when the next one comes out, I'll pick it up, though maybe not right away.

To many he was this brilliant innovator and designer, with a cult-like following. To me though, he's largely been an overpraised Asshole who got more credit than he deserved. <br/><br/>This book has changed my opinions somewhat. 1) He's a larger asshole than even I thought. 2) He does deserves more of the credit that I was was willing to give him for several key impacts to technology and culture.<br/><br/>I earn my living as a Software Engineer. My love of computers came at an early age. My first computer: An Apple IIgs. I came to learn this was basically a souped up version of the original Apple II with improvements borrowed from the Macintosh after that failed to be a success and Steve Jobs was maneuvered out of power at Apple.<br/><br/>While to most people that will never be a device of significance, it changed my life. I still have it. I still love it. It's also the only Apple product I've ever owned, and I wasn't the one who bought it, my parents were. <br/><br/>I've always had a hate/love relationship with Apple. I can appreciate the innovations of many Apple products: The Mac, The iPod, iPhone and iPad. But I've never wanted to own one. I find the closed nature of their products and lack of customization frustrating and a deal breaker. Steve Wozniak is my favorite Apple Steve, not Mr. Jobs.<br/><br/>Without Steve Jobs, some of these products may never have come to be, and certainly not as early. And they certainly wouldn't have been Apple products. <br/><br/>He didn't really design or innovate much though. What he did was push his talented engineers to innovate and accomplish things even they didn't think possible. He largely did this by being an asshole. Constantly. Calling people's ideas shit one week then taking credit for them as his own the next. Oh and that doesn't get into all the issues he had as a father or friend.<br/><br/>I could never have worked for Apple or Jobs. I probably wouldn't have been up to his standards anyways. As a huge computer/technology fan though, this is a must read book. Like him or hate him you can't disregard his impact on not only technology but culture.<br/><br/>My Windows PC (or Linux PC for that matter) wouldn't be the same without the Mac (although I think far too many people are unaware of the innovations of Xerox PARC engineers). My Android phone wouldn't be nearly as good without the iPhone.<br/><br/>My favorite quote from this book came from Bill Gates who said something to the effect that a closed system can work, but only with Jobs at the helm. I think Apple without Steve Jobs isn't nearly as good. I don't think that's because Tim Cook isn't an asshole though. It's because what Steve Jobs had was vision, and good taste for design. Not to mention amazing showmanship. I just don't like his products. But Apple fans are legion, and for good reason.<br/><br/>The Open vs. Closed debate rages on. Both sides have their merits. First it was Apple and Microsoft, now Apple and Google. I'm firmly on the open side, but understand why the closed side is so popular/successful.<br/><br/>Now it feels like innovation has largely stalled as companies are trying to push several technologies (I'm looking at you Smart Watches) that no one seems to really want or care about, and releasing only minor upgrades in hardware and software every year, rather than doing anything groundbreaking. I just hope Apple can start innovating again soon, because we can use the competition again.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs was a complicated person. I'm thankful for his contributions to technology. I'm also thankful I never knew him.",,,1,,,1,2016/03/04,,Like new,,

When bad things happened, I wasn't all that upset. And bad things don't happen the whole time, though it may feel that way to some.<br/><br/>The main point of interest to me was how the Empire of Masks used clever finance, and not military might to conquer.

However if I had to recommend one ""Fantasy Economic"" series, it would definitely be Dagger & Coin over this one.<br/><br/>That brings me to my next point. This is another one of those books that I think isn't being well advertised as the start of a series. I shouldn't be surprised as everything is a series these days. Things do come to a decent conclusion, but it's obvious that things are setup for a longer series fairly early on in the series.<br/><br/>This could be that this is the author's first published novel (at least I believe it is), and sequels are contingent on how well this one does. However I think it should be made clear to the potential reader that they are committing to ""yet another series"", and ideally how long. Standard trilogy? Something longer? One of the reasons I voted for this book over the others, is they were all part of series, and I didn't realize this was as well.<br/><br/>I thought the writing was pretty good, especially for a first time author. I don't recall big info dumps or painful dialogue.<br/><br/>There were definitely parts of this book I enjoyed, but it was uneven. Overall, I thought the world building of the Masked Empire was more interesting than the plot or the characters themselves. I enjoyed learning about the Mask Empire early on in the book, but by the end I found my mind wandering in places and simply eager to just finish the book. <br/><br/>The weaker ending caused me to round down my rating instead of up.

The characters were decent, but I never really connected with the protagonist. He romanticized the past as being far greater than his present. I didn't live through the 70's to compare. It's a tendency of most people to look on the past with rose-colored glasses. Si seems oblivious to many of the issues that plagued many people at that time.<br/><br/>The writing itself was fine as well.

Thankfully I got to listen to the last 6 or so hours in one sitting.<br/><br/>The world building is once again the star for me. However several of the characters have become quite dear to me after so many hours spent with them, especially !Xabbu and Fredricks. Renie still annoyed me at times, but far less than in previous books. So obviously she's grown on me too.<br/><br/>I am sad I'll no longer be wandering through the vast expanse of Otherland with our little troupe of explorers, but I'm happy for the time I got to spend with them.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of cyberpunk and epic fantasy, this series to me was just about the perfect blend of those things.

Thankfully !Xabbu was there to help that story along.  The most interesting plotline for me was probably Orlando, though Paul's story was pretty good as too. The rest of them I found good at times, and very slow at times. It felt like there were far too many POVs this go around. I guess with a 4 book door stopper series like this, that's to be expected, but I feel some of it could have been tightened up.<br/><br/>Much of this book seemed to be a way for Mr. Williams to live out fantasy of worlds he'd like to visit/explore from history and/or fiction. I suspect if he chose more worlds that I found fascinating, I'd have enjoyed those parts much more.

I was not much of a fan. The writing was excellent, but the characters and the plot didn't do much for me.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how to categorize this. Is it sci-fi? Is it fantasy? It is cyberpunk? It has elements of all three, but doesn't exactly fit into any one of them neatly.<br/><br/>This isn't a dystopian story. It's a near future one where computers have enabled in depth virtual reality. It has a very cyberpunk feel at times. Maybe it's post cyberpunk? Then within the virtual reality, we experience many traditional fantasy settings and characters. So it's really a blending of the three.<br/><br/>Regardless of the exact genre, the world hits all of my buttons. I'm a sucker for VR stories. If you mix in fantasy like this does, all the better.<br/><br/>The story took me a bit to get into at first. It's very well written, but there are several subplots, and it took a long time for it to become clear just how they related to each other. This book is very largely a setup book. Much of it seems involve moving characters into the right place and setting up the world.<br/><br/>The characters are pretty well developed and diverse. We have a VR specialist from South Africa named Irene ""Renie"" Sulaweyo and her student a Kalahari Bushman named !Xabbu. There are also the more traditional protagonists in Paul Jonas and Orlando Gardiner. <br/><br/>I found Renie and !Xabbu refreshing as characters, but for me the large draw was the world building and the mystery of the Golden City.

However, I found this one to have the fewest number of slow parts yet.<br/><br/>We finally start to get answers to many of the questions I've had since the first volume. Additionally the pace seems much better. Everything feels more important to the story and the characters journey for answers and not just some exercise in writing for the author.<br/><br/>The prose are once again excellent and I find myself increasingly attached to the characters. This is especially true of Orlando, Fredricks and !Xabbu. Renie who  got on my nerves at times in the last book, was much less so in this book. Paul's plotline provides some of the best reveals of the series thus far, but I found myself a bit less interested in him as I was in the previous two books.<br/><br/>In this novel we start to finally get some convergence of several plotlines that had previously felt only loosely related to one another. We get yet even more new sim worlds to explore, but thankfully they don't seem to be explored for exploration's sake, but with real purpose to the plot. Many of the minor plotlines are starting to finally feel more important as well.<br/><br/>Unlike the previous two, where I found it was easy to take a break with something shorter/lighter, there was no way I couldn't jump into the fourth and final book with how this ends.

The latter being another series I read that has a detective Angel for the protagonist.<br/><br/>I don't think it's nearly as good as Dresden. It reminds me a bit of [b:Storm Front|47212|Storm Front (The Dresden Files, #1)|Jim Butcher|http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1345556917s/47212.jpg|1137060], where the concept is intriguing, but the book itself is only so-so. However, unlike Mr. Butcher, this isn't Mr. Williams first book.<br/><br/>I'd put it on par with Remy Chandler. I think the quality of the writing by Mr. Williams is a little better, but the quality of the plots seems to be about the same. I was pleased to see they both have very different takes on the Angel thing. <br/><br/>While Remy fought in the battle of Heaven and Hell, Bobby is uncertain of many things, including his own past. Bobby doesn't seem to have any kind of super human abilities and is limited by his body. Remy can embrace his Angelic nature and become more powerful/scary.<br/><br/>The book started out OK, but really went on to drag in the middle before picking up steam again at the end to finish alright. He does bring the mystery of the first book to a reasonable conclusion, while setting up some larger mysteries I assume he will address in the next two books.<br/><br/>The other I guess minor gripes I have about the book were the humor and the sex. I don't mind sex in books. It's a large motivator in human (or in this case Angelic) actions.<br/><br/>However Mr. Williams went into a lot more detail (across several chapters) than I thought was necessary. This will likely be popular for the 50 shades of gray/Paranormal Romance crowd, but for me, I just skimmed through it to get on with the actual story. The sex was important to the story, but could have been less detailed without losing any of that.<br/><br/>Humor is very subjective. I love Jim Butcher/Harry Dresden's sense of humor. I didn't really care for Tad Williams/Bobby Dollar's. I could tell some of the places he was trying to make jokes and they just didn't do it for me. He did have 1 or 2 others. It didn't spoil the book by any means, but it just fell short in my eyes.<br/><br/>Overall it was an alright book, and I'll probably try to read the next 2 books in his initial trilogy, but won't be in any rush to do so.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Mr. Krebs gives you the basics on botnets and some of the other techniques common for spammers without going into too much detail to scare the layman off.<br/><br/>If I have one real complaint about the book is that Mr. Kreb's spends too much time talking about himself, especially at the start. I understand that he plays a part in the story, but he spent part of an early chapter complaining about how the Washington Post would make him sit on stories for month due to red tape and legal concerns.<br/><br/>I never really knew the main players in the spam game. I still really don't. That isn't Mr. Kreb's fault though. I'm just really bad at names. He does list them out in the front of the book. Most of the people here were interchangeable to me.

It felt much slower, and in a book this short, I'd have liked more time spent on other things instead of following around a squad of soldiers. It would have worked much better if he cut it in half, and either did more in the final story, or told another story that moved the plot along more.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the other three stories were much better.

Of course things aren't in a vacuum, and given my enjoyment of his later works, this one just isn't as good.<br/><br/>This book was a series of ups and downs for me. I started off a little slow, but built up as it went on. I liked most of the characters. The normal Scalzi snark is present, but not as funny as in his other works.<br/><br/>The premise itself is an amusing one. Thomas Stein is an up and coming young agent in Hollywood. He works for one of the top agency's in L.A. His boss is probably one of the best known people in all of Hollywood. It is for that reasons that aliens contact him. <br/><br/>The very benign Yherajk have a problem. Despite being very peaceful, they look terrifying, and smell worse. They've been watching our movies and TV for years, and worry about how the human race will react. They decide they need an agent. Tom is chosen by his boss as someone who can spare the time to work the problem without being found out.<br/><br/>Of course things don't go exactly as planned.<br/><br/>Just as I was really enjoying the story, the book took a turn. It really changed the whole tone of the book for me. It went from being a light sci-fi story to something more serious, and characters I liked were pondering actions I didn't like.<br/><br/>Things righted themselves a bit, and the ending saved the story from going completely off the rails for me.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say this is one that could safely be skipped by all the biggest Scalzi fans.

He's surrounded by some better people than he deserves and is often unappreciative of them.<br/><br/>However, he proves to be infinitely less of an asshat than some of the other humans on planet, even if it takes him a little while to get there.

It's really just a stand alone as far as I can tell. It's easy to just read this without committing myself to reading more books.<br/><br/>What you have here is a short and interesting tale focused around Han Solo and Chewbacca with smaller appearances of some of the others (Luke, Leia, R2D2, C3PO). So if you're looking for light saber battles and the force, you probably want to pick another book (just don't ask me which one).<br/><br/>There isn't some real deep plot or major revelations here. There can't be really. The book is set between episode 4 and 5. You know that none of the main characters are ever in real danger of dying because they are around in episode 5. Original characters are fair game though.<br/><br/>The original characters (or at least ones I've never heard of before) are all pretty good. The other main character of this is Scarlet Hark a rebel spy who needs extraction from the center of imperial space. And guess who has to go get her? I also particularly enjoy Hunter Maas.<br/><br/>The real winner here is the dialogue though. Maybe it has extra pop for me since I listened to it rather than reading it, but they seem to really capture the mannerisms of the characters that I remember and love from the movies. Han especially. The interactions between him and Leia are really good. There is even a ""Han Shot First"" joke in there.<br/><br/>So if your a Star Wars noob like me, should you start here? I'm not sure. It seemed to work for me though and now I'm excited to check out some more books later this year. Even if you're a bigger fan, I think there is a lot to like here, especially if you go the audio book route.",,,1,,Tom Schreck,0,,,,,

That would make it sound like I didn't like it, but that’s not the case.<br/><br/>I've always been more of a Star Trek fan than dystopian sci-fi fan. When it comes to Space Opera, I like politics and war at a higher level. Large factions feuding over planets and ideals.<br/><br/>For me the first three books really sort of fell more into this. This book however felt much lower level. The politics of the first three books serve as the basis for things. There has always been discrimination between the belters and the inner planets, but never has it been so central to the conflict as in this book.<br/><br/>That may appeal to some reasons, for me it mostly made me uncomfortable and mad. Not at the book or the authors, but the characters. I think most authors would be happy to evoke strong emotions in their readers, but for me personally I generally don’t like to spend my recreation time angry.<br/><br/>As seems to be par for the course, we get a bunch of brand new POV characters this go around, save for James Holden. Two of them are minor characters from previous novels. First there is Havelock, who was Miller’s Earther partner in [b:Leviathan Wakes|8855321|Leviathan Wakes (Expanse, #1)|James S.A. Corey|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1289046195s/8855321.jpg|13730452], and Basia who was a friend of Prax on Ganymede in [b:Caliban's War|12591698|Caliban's War (Expanse, #2)|James S.A.

I think she is the weakest female character they’ve written yet. I still wish they'd bring back Bobbie and Avasarala (thankfully there looks to be potential for this in book 5). I loved them so much that everyone else seem to disappoint me. I felt Anna in [b:Abaddon's Gate|16131032|Abaddon's Gate (Expanse, #3)|James S.A. Corey|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1388202946s/16131032.jpg|17606564] was already a step down, but still likeable. Elvi was another step in the wrong direction for me as well.<br/><br/>So you have a bunch of characters you don't really like in what to me felts like a side story for most of the book. They do stupid and hateful things to one another. I know the types of people portrayed in this book exist in the world. Maybe they once existed in greater numbers. Maybe I’m just sheltered or fortunate not to run into these kinds of people on a regular basis.<br/><br/>The whole thing just made no sense to me. Everyone’s actions were stupid. I was especially bothered that many of the Engineers were the worst. Most of the engineers I know are very logical and well thought out in their actions. Sure there are exceptions to that, but this seemed to flip that on their head.<br/><br/>I despised Murtry, head of the Earther's security and all around asshole. I'm pretty sure that was the point. The problem was I didn't feel like I had anything to root for. I spent most of the book wishing Holden and his crew would just leave and go do something else that was related to the protomolecule and the developments from [b:Abaddon's Gate|16131032|Abaddon's Gate (Expanse, #3)|James S.A. Corey|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1388202946s/16131032.jpg|17606564].<br/><br/>Overall this book seemed to focus on the worse things that humanity is capable of. Discrimination and pointless violence. Spending way too much time and energy trying to kill one another when there are far larger problems to worry about.<br/><br/>Despite this, I ended up enjoying the book. I found it hard to turn off when it was time to stop listening. I’m still not sure how they pulled that off. Eventually I did find myself liking Havelock and Basia more though. Elvi still felt like she was there to serve at a 4th ""camera"" most of the time. She was important to the plot, but I just never grew attached to her I guess.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the final quarter of the book a lot more than the first three. We eventually get some development of things with the protomolecule, though not as much as I would have preferred. I just really enjoy spending time with the crew of the Rocinante, no matter what’s going on.<br/><br/>With the announcement of 3 more books, I worry things will be drawn out too much. Personally I’d like the protomolecule story arc to get wrapped up by book 6, and have the three new books be a completely new story arc. Time will tell what happens. Either way I’ll be eagerly picking up book 5 when it comes out.<br/>",,,1,,,1,2014/06/17,Audible,Like new,,

I just didn't think Mr. Abercrombie could do YA well. And that book seemed to prove me right. It was alright, but it felt just flat and uninteresting.<br/><br/>So I was even more reluctant to pick this one up. My hold for the library seemed to get held up, and I was OK with that.

I'm now adding my voice to that statement.<br/><br/>This is more like it. Compared to his First Law books, things are still toned down, but compared to the first book things are a lot more gritty and all around interesting. <br/><br/>The first improvement I found is that Yarvi is no longer a POV character. I didn't care much for him in the last book. I thought him a much more interesting character as viewed from the outside than from within. However the difference could also be that some time has passed as he's developed from annoying boy into interesting young man. It's hard to say for sure.<br/><br/>The next improvement is his new POV characters. Thorn and Brand are a lot more memorable and well developed than most of the characters in Half the World. They also contrast each other nicely. Thorn is a bit reminiscent of Monza Murcatto or Ferro Maljinn. Brutal, fierce, and angry.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Brand reminds me a bit of Collem West. He has a good heart, and sometimes pays the price for it. Neither character is recycled though. Instead he revisits some old ideas in new ways.<br/><br/>Being a YA book, I guess it's required to have some awkward  will they / won't they love subplots or something? I could have probably done without it, but overall I thought it was handled fairly well.<br/><br/>The world building continues to be a bit sparse, but interesting. The elven ruins and magic intrigues me. My discussion group brought up the similarities to modern technology. Is this really a post apocalyptic version of our world? We know there was some sort of major catastrophe in the past. I'd really like to know more about this aspect, but I don't think we'll ever really know.<br/><br/>Parts of the books were a bit predictable still, yet still a pleasure to read. It was a real page turner through most of it.

This book has only despicable characters.<br/><br/>First, we have the protagonist, a former mercenary bent of revenge.<br/><br/>Then we're got her assortment of ""friends"":<br/><br/>- A 'master' poisoner and his assistant<br/><br/>- A Northern Barbarian whose best skill is killing.<br/><br/>- A serial killer with an obsession for numbers. Rain Man he's not.<br/><br/>- Another mercenary whose loyalties are fluid based on whose paying the most.<br/><br/>- And a ""retired"" torturer<br/><br/>You know it's a bad sign when the most likable character is probably the serial killer.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean the characters are badly written. They are certainly quite entertaining too. Nicomo Cosca is especially amusing. But with no one really being likable to me, I wasn't sure what/who I was routing for by the end.<br/><br/>That sort of makes it a weird book to me. Typically even if the main character is ""bad"" they have some redeeming qualities or something to make them into a sort of anti-hero.<br/><br/>Monzcarro Murcatto may have had some redeeming qualities once, but now she is bitter and angry and won't let anything stand in the way of her revenge.<br/><br/>I think Mr. Abercrombie does do a good job in taking some minor characters from the first series and promoting them to larger roles in this stand alone novel. I think this also ties thing together nicely with the First Law trilogy without really spoiling things much.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend reading First Law BEFORE tackling this book. Sure it's stand alone, but there is a lot of context and references you'll miss if you haven't read that first.<br/><br/>As a fantasy book, this was pretty light on the fantasy. It could almost have been an alternate history book if it weren't set in Mr. Abercrombie's First Law universe. <br/><br/>At its heart this is a revenge story. Monzo is determined to make the ones who wronged her pay. It makes for a fun romp full of unexpected consequences and lots of action. <br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed it.

The characters are interesting, diverse and have a lot of depth.<br/><br/>If you would have told me I'd like an arrogant spoiled rich noble, and deformed malicious torturer as characters before this book, I wouldn't have believed you. <br/><br/>And that's neglecting to mention Logen ""The Bloody Nine"".

His characters all have flaws, some of them major, yet I find myself liking and rooting for them all somehow.<br/><br/>I have two small fall criticisms of the book that prevent me from giving it a 5:<br/><br/>1) Lack of strong female characters. They aren't absent, just secondary. Both Ardee and Ferro are well developed in this story, but most (all?) of the point of view story telling is from the various other male protagonists, of which there are 5, compared to only 2 females, one of which only appears occasionally (Ardee) and the other (Ferro) who isn't introduced until much later in the book.<br/><br/>One thing I think that [a:George R.R. Martin|346732|George R.R. Martin|http://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1351944410p2/346732.jpg] does well is providing a sense of realism, yet still offering a good mix of female characters. I'm hoping we see more from Ardee and Ferro in the next book, and hopefully some additional woman as well.<br/><br/>2) As I mentioned in my summary, this book lacks some kind of short term goal. If there is any goal, it's essentially getting the group together to go on a quest of sorts. That's not really explained very well.

This isn't the first fantasy series to do this, but it meshed in well and added an interesting element to the overall story.<br/><br/>Things built up slowly and then finally became interesting, but then seemed to slow way down again. Then it got interesting again before slowing down as things were sort of wrapped up in the final section. This made the pacing pretty uneven to me. The fight scenes and the actual rebellion didn't do much for me. And that's a large part of this book.<br/><br/>What I did enjoy was the actual plotting and administration of government. I appreciated the contrast between Kuni, Mata and the various Kings/Emperors. In some ways it was a bit too optimistic. Kuni is far from a perfect person, but seems incredibly proficient as a leader. Meanwhile Mata is entirely too stupid. Some of the characters actions just didn't make a lot of sense to me.<br/><br/>The other main issue I had was the female characters. This book had some really great ones. Jia, Soto and another I'll refrain from naming. However it felt like it took him far too long to include them as more than just minor characters in the book. I felt Jia was especially underused. I would have liked more time and involvement from them. <br/><br/>For much of the book it seems to be yet another fantasy world where women are relegated to the side lines/dismissed by most male characters.

Since that time I had several friends telling me I had to read it. <br/><br/>I was reluctant to do though, because the third book hasn't been published and there is no real eta in sight. I was content to wait until at least their was an announced publish date. Until last year that is, when I finally caved and read both books with a few friends. I'm glad I finally did, though now I'm stuck waiting for the final book like everyone else.<br/><br/>I seem to be in a minority of the fans I've talked to who thought that [b:The Name of the Wind|186074|The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)|Patrick Rothfuss|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1270352123s/186074.jpg|2502879] was good, but [b:The Wise Man's Fear|1215032|The Wise Man's Fear (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #2)|Patrick Rothfuss|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1297311431s/1215032.jpg|2502882] was much better. So maybe that will put me in the minority of fans once again who find myself a bit disappointed with this story.<br/><br/>Originally slated for [b:Rogues|20168816|Rogues|George R.R. Martin|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1404616147s/20168816.jpg|27565413], Mr. Rothfuss set this one aside and wrote The Lightning Tree instead. It has a similar feel to this. We follow Bast around for a day in the life. I really loved that story. I felt like we got some good insights to his character we didn't in the main novels.<br/><br/>Auri is definitely one of my favorite characters in his books, so I was really excited to see he had a novella about her coming out. Until I saw the price. I like to support authors I read so they will hopefully continue to write more stories I enjoy, but $17 for a 150 page novella seems crazy to me. So maybe I was already in a negative mindset coming into this book.<br/><br/>I was planning to wait until I could get a copy from the library and if I enjoyed it, picking up a copy for my shelves if/when the price came down. However, I was fortunate enough to receive an early review copy of the audio book, making the price irrelevant to me personally.<br/><br/>So I've written all these words now (and apparently you've kept reading them) and still really haven't talked about the book. That seems appropriate because there really isn't a story here. <br/><br/>We follow Auri around for a week. We do get some insights into her thought process. Maybe someone smarter than me will argue we get a lot of insights. Maybe if I read it again, I'll come away with more. I don't know. What I really wanted was to know more about Auri's background more so than her character. As far as I'm concerned, you get none of that here. Maybe I'm just not smart enough.<br/><br/>And that brings me to why I rounded down my rating of 3.5 to a 3. I was all set to round up to 4 because I really like [a:Patrick Rothfuss|108424|Patrick Rothfuss|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1351307341p2/108424.jpg], and I really like Auri. He seems like a generally nice guy who does a lot of great things for other people with his success and influence. <br/><br/>But Mr. Rothfuss felt the need to include this long author's note at the end. He makes it out like an apology to his fans who may not ""get"" this book, or don't like it. But to me it came off as insincere and really more like him turning up his nose at anyone who doesn't love this story as much as Vi Hart.<br/><br/>And the thing is, I didn't dislike it for any of the reasons he mentioned. This book definitely FEELS like Auri. I liked all the randomness. Auri's OCD makes me feel way better about my own. She really is a great character, and that shines through here. As I said my main disappointment was getting nothing about Auri's back story.<br/><br/>But to talk about ""There are plenty of stories out there for you, even if this one isn't"" came off condescending to me. I'm probably just reading it the wrong way, because Mr. Rothfuss never stuck me as that sort of person before now.<br/><br/>So if you want a story where nothing really of note happens and to just spend time with Auri, you'll probably love this story. If you like me were hoping for some kind of back story, you may be disappointed like I was. There definitely were a few hints dropped, but nothing that made any real sense to me, just left me with more questions than before I read it.",,,1,,,1,2014/10/15,Review Copy,Like new,,

It reminds me more of [a:Daniel Suarez|1956402|Daniel Suarez|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1265394868p2/1956402.jpg] than the stuff of his I have read. If nothing else this book renews my desire to read some more of his work.<br/><br/>This one is hard to categorize. I'd guess techo-thriller is maybe the best? It's also a time travel book. Sort of. The time stuff definitely falls into the Back to the Future 2 category (altering the past forks it to a new future).<br/><br/>I think both protagonists are pretty good, though Flynne is easily the better of the two. She keeps herself together way better than I would under the circumstances she faces. Netherton is much less interesting, and took me a bit to warm up to, but by the end, I enjoyed his chapters almost as much as Flynne's. Though that may simply be due to the amount of overlap of the two.<br/><br/>The world building could have been a little better. There is this mysterious Jackpot, that while explained eventually, wasn't really explained in a lot of detail. I guess it was to move the plot along more than anything. We get glimpses of both Flynne's and Netherton's worlds, though not as much as I'd have liked.<br/><br/>There is a bunch of technology in this one. Some of it looks familiar like tablets and drones. The rest of it sounds familiar like robots, advanced haptic controls, and embedded phones. There is no big dreaming here. Everything Mr. Gibson writes seems feasible, and some of it probably not too far off.<br/><br/>At it's core though, this is really just a thriller. There are shady characters and a mysterious murder drives the plot. I probably would have preferred something more cyberpunk, but I have no idea if still writes those kinds of books anymore.<br/><br/>I found it a quick listen, at just over fourteen hours I did most of it over a busy weekend of chores and bike riding.

It left me apprehensive for this book. <br/><br/>I shouldn't have been. That isn't to say bad things don't happen to our beloved Fitz. Any fan of the Ederling books won't be surprised by that.

However with other obligations and coordinating reading schedules it had to wait a little bit.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first book, but this one was a step up for me. The characters and the main plot are set. The journey is on. Now we can just sit back and see what happens. <br/><br/>Ms. Hobb has always had a slow plot development to me. For some reason it just works with me in a way other authors don't. This is really the second half of [b:The Dragon Keeper|4703450|The Dragon Keeper (Rain Wild Chronicles, #1)|Robin Hobb|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1330079386s/4703450.jpg|4767778].<br/><br/>The way Ms. Hobb writes animals has always impressed me. Nighteyes felt like a real wolf to me. Her cats were especially good too. She's done it again here with Dragons.<br/><br/>Of course no one knows what a dragon would be like, but she still seems to paint a picture that just feels right to me. Intelligent and arrogant. Only these aren't full dragons. Their development was stunted. Their memories aren't complete. They can't fly and have to rely on humans to help care for them.<br/><br/>There is a lot of development of both the dragons and their keepers in this book, as well as the supporting barge and crew. They face the first real adversity of their journey to find an ancient lost city of the Elderlings where the dragons may be able to thrive.<br/><br/>At its heart, this is a story about relationships.

I loved [b:Fool's Fate|45108|Fool's Fate (Tawny Man, #3)|Robin Hobb|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1388181998s/45108.jpg|2960725] (<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/404258538"">My Review</a>). I've enjoyed all of Ms. Hobb's books but that's the only one I've given 5 stars too. I was just so satisfied with how it ended. Sure there were questions, but all the big things were resolved.<br/><br/>So would this book ruin my favorite book? Well not yet, but it certainly hasn't alleviated my fears that the events of this trilogy won't tarnish things for me.<br/><br/>Like many books by Ms. Hobb, things start out slow. I don't mean that in a negative way however. Somehow she is able to write in such a way that I don't mind the day to day life of her books. Despite my trepidation, it just felt nice to be back with characters I love. If you're looking for a lot of action or a flashy start, you'll be disappointed. I imagine that anyone picking up this book is already going to be a Robin Hobb fan and used to her style though.<br/><br/>More than anything, Ms. Hobb's writing is able to evoke strong emotions in me as I read. Love, anger, happiness, frustration. Few other authors can make me despise a new character so quickly or completely. Similarly Fitz continues to frustrate me with the way he does things in a way that is just all too human. Often times the protagonist in a fantasy book faces external adversity and rises to the occasion. Meanwhile Fitz is frequently his own worst enemy. Poor Ms. Hobb loves putting him through the ringer too, and this book is no different.<br/><br/>I had three issues with this book costing it that fifth. The first one I suspect many long-time Hobb fans will share. The other two may largely depend on the reader.<br/><br/>The series is called Fitz & Fool. The book is called Fool's Assassin. So why did it take so long for us to see the Fool? Sure he's mentioned often enough, but I want to spend time with him just as I am spending time with Fitz. So far this series seems a lot more like Farseer than Tawny Man in that regard.<br/><br/>The second thing was the addition of a POV besides Fitz. I guess I'm a very jealous reader. I originally hoped it was a one off thing early in the book, but when it turned out to be a regular thing it bothered me. I felt robbed of time I could be spending with Fitz. By the end of the book it grew on me and I came to look forward to those chapters nearly as much as I did the Fitz ones.<br/><br/>The final issue I had was the ending. I know this is the first book of a trilogy, but I hate cliffhanger type endings, and this one seemed pretty bad to me. If you're the type of person who hates waiting for the next book, you may be better off waiting until the final book is either published or has a release date. It's going to a be a LONG wait for me until book 2.<br/><br/>Overall I really liked, but didn't love this book. I'm still pretty nervous about what may happen next. I think that above all shows how great a writer Ms. Hobb is to fill me with both a sense of anticipation and dread for the next book in the series.",,,1,,,1,2014/08/05,Review Copy,Like new,,

Probably from Sword & Laser, which selected it for the June 2013 pick.<br/><br/>There are several things in this book I greatly identify with. There is one scene when the main character meets other people who share her interest in sci-fi and fantasy books and feels both self-conscious about that she is talking too much and yet at the same time is unable to control herself. I've been there entirely too many times in my life, especially after long periods of mostly being alone and catching up with friends.<br/><br/>The main part that I identify with is losing yourself in books. This is something I seem to be doing more and more of lately, for several reasons. I'm thankful for good reads as an outlet to discuss them all, and to find other people who read as much as I do.<br/><br/>So why only 3 stars? Well there were three main reasons:<br/><br/>1) The early part felt very ramblely to me. As someone prone to rambling I can forgive this in conversation, but not really in a book. It's meant as a diary of a teenage girl, so this is probably realistic, but was too realistic for me. <br/><br/>This leads me to my next problem:<br/><br/>2) As the diary of the teen-aged girl, there were parts I just couldn't identify with. Having never been a girl myself, and understanding entirely too little about the female species in general some parts of this book were just awkward for me. Not a fault of the book, just something that didn't resonate with me personally.<br/><br/>And my final drawback was:<br/><br/>3) All the book references. I'd like to think I've read a decent number of books in my nearly 30 year reading career (I don't remember exactly what age I started reading books). I've tracked over 200 books on good reads, and I know there are books I've read missing from the list, especially if I counted all the stuff I read as a kid. <br/><br/>There are at least 80 books referenced in this novel from the various lists I've seen. I've read less than 10 of them. That made for a lot of references I'm sure I just missed out on. This is another thing that isn't the book's fault. <br/><br/>This book is set in 79/80. I was born in 82. I didn't really start reading a ton of sci-fi or fantasy until the early 2000s. Most of what I've read was written after I was born.<br/><br/>I LOVED [b:Ready Player One|9969571|Ready Player One|Ernest Cline|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1333576871s/9969571.jpg|14863741]. It's chock full of geeky 70's and 80's nostalgia. If you took that away, the book wouldn't have been nearly as good. So that might be exactly what's happened here for me.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm glad I read this, but I'm also glad I'm glad I opted to borrow it from the library. With inter-library loan no less!

It contains all the same elements that drove me nuts in the first book: Cartoonish villains, juvenile wish fulfillment, and stupid and obnoxious characters; albeit in lesser quantities.<br/><br/>I think it's a combination of things. I love the magic school trope, and we get a lot of that here, at least to some degree. We also get more of Iron Fist who was probably the only character from the first book I liked the entire time. There is the addition of Teia, who I like a lot despite sharing some of the same annoying characteristics of Karris. However, she's got more of an excuse.<br/><br/>You also finally get a lot more explanation of the magic that I found lacking in the first book. There is still a hand waving, but I found myself no longer caring as much.<br/><br/>Kip is still obnoxious though. I think this book would be a lot better with a different protagonist. I like the idea of doing a parody of the chosen one trope, and I think it works well for this series. I just wish he did it different somehow.

Andross Guile makes for an interesting antagonist at times, but is over the top in his actions far too often.

It's been about a year since then, and my memory on the details were fuzzy. I should have reread. I wish there was a wiki or something with plot points and character bios I could have used to refresh myself.<br/><br/>I struggled at the start remembering many of the minor characters. I think all books in a series (and really all audio books in general) should have a list of the important characters with maybe a 1 sentence reminder of who they are. It would really help a lot. There are just too many books to reread previous books every time a new one comes out, even books I loved as much as the last two.<br/><br/>Both of those books grabbed me early on and never let go.

Nintendo is a rather secretive company, so Mr. Ryan can be forgiven for not having all the details. I found the history both informative and entertaining.<br/><br/>Two things set this book ahead of [b:Console Wars: Sega, Nintendo, and the Battle that Defined a Generation|18505802|Console Wars  Sega, Nintendo, and the Battle that Defined a Generation|Blake J. Harris|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1391419511s/18505802.jpg|26198818] for me:<br/><br/>1) It actually had details about Nintendo, whereas that book had very little considering it has it in the title.<br/>2) Mr. Ryan doesn't make up fake conversations to tell the story.<br/><br/>This book does jump around in time a bit, but that's largely because he focuses on different parts of Nintendo with each chapter. He covers mostly consoles for much of the book, and then circles back to talk about Gameboy later in the book.<br/><br/>In my 20's I abandoned Nintendo as they seemed to be stuck in the past, and I wanted new games and better variety. After buying every system from NES to Gamecube, I was now an XBox person.<br/><br/>Now in my 30s, I find myself wanting to play Mario, Link and Donkey Kong again. I've been awfully tempted to buy a Wii U over the Xbox One. <br/><br/>Personally, I still feel like Nintendo would do better going the route of Sega by putting their IPs on as many platforms as possible and leaving the hardware business behind. Shows what I know though. This book talks about how the Wii absolutely crushed the Xbox 360 and PS3 for many months. Nintendo seems content in letting Microsoft and Sony to fight over the hardcore adult gamers and focus on kids, casual fans, and the Mario/Link/etc diehards.<br/><br/>If you're like me and grew up on the NES/SNES and want to revisit your childhood gaming, this seems like a good book to do it with.",,,1,Fans of Nintendo in the 80s & 90s,,1,2015/11/19,Audible,Like new,,

Yet he's still better than a lot of readers out there and I'll likely continue going the audiobook route with this series despite the volume issue.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>Writing reviews for books I love goes one of two ways: They either come gushing out of me because I'm so excited to share my love with everyone, or I struggle to put my thoughts into words, afraid of not doing the book justice. I worry this will be more of the latter than the former.<br/><br/>I generally don't give out 5 star ratings. I like to save them for books I really love so it's a sign that ""hey Rob must have really liked this one"". I don't exactly have a metric for what pushes a 4/4.5 star book to 5 star rating. It just sort of by feel.<br/><br/>The easiest way for me to quantify it though is that it's a book that I hate to stop and can't wait to pick up again. This book was easily that. It was also an easy add to my favorites shelf.<br/><br/>This book didn't grab me immediately, but pretty close. Once it did it never let go. It's hard to say why I loved it so much. It's a typical chosen one story. It's also got a bit of the school trope to it, though that's only part of the book.<br/><br/>At first it reminds me a lot of [b:The Name of the Wind|186074|The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)|Patrick Rothfuss|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1270352123s/186074.jpg|2502879]. Our main protagonist is an infamous man whose collected numerous names over the years, and is recounting his life story to a chronicler as a flashback, with occasional interludes back to present day. Sound Familiar?<br/><br/>However this basic structure is really where the similarity ends for me. Vaelin is a paladin (or maybe warrior monk?), where Kvothe is a bard (at least in my mind). He's far from perfect, and was instantly more likable to me.<br/><br/>I think what really hooked me in the story is the mystery and lore. There is a lot to discover in both the history of the Order that Vaelin is now a member, but also surrounding magic, regarded with superstition, anger and fear and referred to by most as ""The Dark"". The magic is sort of not that prevalent for most of the book, nor all that well explained, but I enjoyed how Mr. Ryan incorporated it into the story.<br/><br/>The other thing I really enjoyed is all the politics and religion. Religion and politics are tightly coupled and ""The Faith"" of the Order is embedded in the rule of the Unified Realm. Like the real world arguments over religion and politics lead to conflict and war.<br/><br/>King Janus is determined to leave a legacy for his son, and will use Vaelin how he sees fit to accomplish it.<br/><br/>The cast of characters felt well developed and balanced. Coming from different backgrounds and parts of the realm, Vaelin and his brothers make for an interesting group, each excelling at certain skills honed through training rather than just excelling at EVERYTHING. We also have a few strong female characters, although they don't really take center stage in this book.<br/><br/>Overall I think this book just put a lot of my favorites parts of fantasy tropes together in a way that just hits my buttons in the right way and made it a great read for me. The writing seems really polished for a first novel. I'm sure there are things that can be picked apart about the story or the writing, but I just don't want to hear them. <br/><br/>I will end my ramblings hoping that I have I have convinced you to check out this series.

I haven't read all of his books, but I've enjoyed all but 1 of those that I have.<br/><br/>I had no idea what this book was about when I volunteered to review it. Much like most of his work, it's long. The start is a bit slow, and as usual it goes off on tangents and into way more detail than is necessary on things. In some of his books, I've enjoyed those tangents and the excess of detail. In others, less so. This one was somewhere in the middle for me.<br/><br/>This is the kind of thing that will turn many readers away early on. I was never bored myself, but I wasn't really engaged in the book until nearly halfway. In a book this long, that will be too much of a commitment for many. However, I suspect if you enjoy the detail and tangents, you'll be engaged much sooner.<br/><br/>This book is split into three parts. The first part is essentially a present day disaster story. The second is largely a space opera, and the third is a bit of a post apocalyptic tale.<br/><br/>Many authors might have focused on one aspect of this story. Instead of giving us bits of history that help shaped the world of part 3, we live many of the details in parts 1 and 2. For me personally, I would have liked part 1 to be shorter with more time spent on part 3. Part 2 was my favorite of the book, but that may be because I felt despite being a third of the book, part 3 ended too soon. <br/><br/>I have questions still. A lot of them. Is Mr. Stephenson planning a sequel that will contain some of these answers? I hope so.<br/><br/>This isn't a case of a long book that abruptly ends though. For me the issue is that Mr. Stephenson did such a good job with the world building that I want more. I felt like there wasn't enough. I would have happily sacrificed much of the present day (which I found slower anyways), for more time in the future story with the world he created.<br/><br/>Mr. Stephenson doesn't spend all the time on world building either. He develops several interesting characters that are used to make most of the story character-driven. We have a largely female cast, and somewhat diverse background for most of them. <br/><br/>Overall, while this isn't my favorite Neal Stephenson book, I really enjoyed it, and I hope we get another book set in the same world that he built in part 3.",,,1,,,1,2015/07/15,Review Copy,Like new,,

It's not really science fiction. It's really just a thriller with a technical starting point. Just like cryptography serves as a backdrop for that book, Gaming (particularly MMO's) does so here. <br/><br/>Only while the cryptography serves as a pretty constant part of that story, things take a 90 degree turn away from the MMO stuff here for awhile. I initially found that very disappointing. I'm a recovering World of Warcraft junkie and I was hoping for some kind of cyberpunk MMO story. That's not the case though, so if that's what you're looking for as well, you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>While we start off in typical Neal Stephenson fashion with immense detail about the design and development of T'Rain, and a virus associated with it called Reamde, this book is really more of a character driven thriller that feels almost more like a spy novel than anything sci-fi.<br/><br/>With a book this long, and Mr. Stephenson's tendency to go into more detail on certain things than is ever necessary, I found it got bogged down in parts and just wishing he would get back to the game.<br/><br/>However as things went on, I really came to like his characters. I never found anyone's story to be too uninteresting or slow, it was really some of his tangents that were the problem, and general lack of Richard Forthrast, whom the blurb leads you to believe is the main character. He's not. He's an important party, but really this is his niece Zula's story. <br/><br/>I found he to be a really enjoyable protagonist. The characters in this book have far more depth than some of his others, but this one will live or die on how much you like the characters I think. Zula is smart, capable and level-headed who continually tries to make the best of bad situations. Things maybe get a little bit close to ""chosen one"" levels, but for the most part I think Mr. Stephenson does a good job in creating a back story to make things stay closer to ""feasible"" than fiction.<br/><br/>So will you enjoy this one? Hard for me to say. If you liked [b:Cryptonomicon|816|Cryptonomicon|Neal Stephenson|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1327931476s/816.jpg|1166797] then maybe. If you enjoy spy thrillers, then probably.

[b:Snow Crash|830|Snow Crash|Neal Stephenson|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1320544000s/830.jpg|493634] is one of my favorite books. While this book is more historical fiction than sci-fi (and certainly not cyberpunk), it has the same geeky humor that I loved in [b:Snow Crash|830|Snow Crash|Neal Stephenson|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1320544000s/830.jpg|493634] so much.<br/><br/>The book has two time periods: The 1940's starting shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the mid-late 90s. <br/><br/>There are several point of view characters for the 40's timeline, but the primary one is Lawrence Waterhouse, an often misunderstood and awkward mathematical genius.<br/><br/>Waterhouse gets blown off by Einstein but becomes friends with Alan Turing. He eventually is put to work breaking codes of both the Japanese and later the Germans during the war.<br/><br/>Meanwhile in the ""present"" Randall is Unix Guru working with his friend Abby to set up their next business venture in the Philippines.<br/><br/>The other point of view characters include Goto Dango, a Japanese soldier, and Bobby Shafto an American soldier. Their stories augment the main narrative of Waterhouse's.<br/><br/>This book has several tangents, including one on beards and another on bicycles. Many of his tangents turn ordinary thinking into mathematical equations. I found most of them interesting if not amusing, but they are of little importance to the story, so I can see people complaining of the excess in what is a rather lengthy book.<br/><br/>The stories of the two timelines eventually converge in a way that wasn't very apparent to me until about the midway point or so.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the book, although I'd be happy with some follow-up as I was left with several questions, though mostly minor ones.<br/><br/>Most of my questions relate to the historical accuracy of many events in the story. People like Alan Turing were quite real, as was his involvement in the British efforts to break German codes during the war. There is work involving the Enigma, but the names of the Japanese codes appear to have been changed, as well as replacing several of the people involved with fictional characters.<br/><br/>At some point I hope to find/read a non-fiction book (or books) on the breaking of codes in World War 2, and I am now fascinated by it.",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

This is only the seventh Star Wars book I've read, and four of them are no longer cannon. I found [b:Aftermath|25131600|Aftermath (Star Wars  Aftermath, #1)|Chuck Wendig|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1426620007s/25131600.jpg|44828548] to be the most underwhelming of those I've read. I'm not sure if it's that so few of the characters I knew/loved were largely absent, or if Mr. Wendig was handcuffed by his book coming out before the Force Awakens rather than after. Either way, this book was a vast improvement to me over the first.<br/><br/>The story still largely focuses on the characters introduced in the last book. I originally found them mostly uninteresting, but that seemed to change with this book. I'm not sure if it's because their story no longer felt small/unimportant in the grand scheme of the larger Star Wars universe, or because I liked them more than I realized. Jas continues to be my favorite of the bunch, but I found myself happier to Nora, Sinjir, Temmin and Mr. Bones than I expected to be.<br/><br/>Finally though, we see some of the big players in the Star Wars universe. There are no longer on the periphery, but important to the story of Mr. Wendig's original characters. The first book did a lot to set things up I guess, but I found myself largely uninterested. Initially I was thinking this book was going to be more of the same, but somewhere around the 25-30% mark this book really ramped things up. Now I couldn't wait to listen, and really wanted to know what came next.<br/><br/>In this world of media overload, it's a lot to ask someone to ""get through 1.25 books for the story to be worth it"", however for anyone whose already read the first book, I think it's more than worth it to give the series another shot with this book.<br/><br/>We finally get to see some of the ties this book has to not only the original series, but to the Force Awakens. It's possible (likely?) there were some things in the first book I just overlooked because I had yet to see the movie, but even in this book I found them just the smallest connections so far. Like what's so great about Jakku?<br/><br/>I suspect in the third book we may get more clarification on things that have been set up so far. At least I hope so. I probably hate spoilers more than most people, but I hope Mr. Wendig's third book won't feel like it's been handcuffed by episode 8, much like the first one did by The Force Awakens.<br/><br/>I wasn't planning to pick this one up until a review copy fell in my lap, but now I can't wait to see what happens next. This one is definitely up there as a possibility of my favorite Star Wars book (as short of a list as that may be). I don't really expect to dive deep into the vast chasm of the Star Wars books, but I'm glad I gave this series a second try.  I'll definitely be picking up the third one when it comes out.",,,1,,,1,2016/07/13,Review Copy,Like new,,

And Io is very different from Tao. The relationship between the two is also very different. That said, I found some of the initial plotting very similar to that book.

I really loved that series and can't wait for the follow on series.<br/><br/>I was disappointed with Tor's decision to release this book around the same time as several other SFF books I was eagerly awaiting, making fitting it in a challenge. June or August would have been better for me personally. I'm sure that sort of thing will vary from person to person, but I only know one other person who read this book so far.<br/><br/>However, I was eager to support him with his first ""big"" publisher release, and see how well he could write in a different world. My results were a bit mixed.<br/><br/>Most of my issues are expectations. With a book called Time Salvager and a synopsis saying how the protagonist: ""<i>James is a chronman, undertaking missions into Earth's past to recover resources and treasure without altering the timeline</i>"" I expected there to be far more time travel than there was. To be fair, there is a decent amount by the end, it was just not what I expected.<br/><br/>I do think Mr. Chu does a good job with the Time Travel. Then again, I'm not a hard sci-fi person who gets caught up in thinking out the consequences/side effects of time travel. Thankfully I don't have to, as many of those things are addressed in the book.<br/><br/>I also didn't realize this was the first book of a series. I guess I should have either assumed so (stand alone books are a dying breed lately) or maybe I just missed that the first time I read a synopsis. When you're nearing the end of a book you think to be stand alone, wondering how the author is going to wrap things up, and it just sort of ends, that's extremely jarring.<br/><br/>After reading his Tao series, I also expected his characters to be a lot more likeable. I came around on some of them in the end, but I despised most of them for a large portion of the book. That's likely by intention, but I have a much harder time reading books with characters I don't like. James character developed as the book went on, making him more likeable. Meanwhile Levin didn't really change at all, he simply was made more likeable by his proximity to another character far more despicable.<br/><br/>The thing is, I always enjoyed reading this book when I picked it up. The writing is excellent, the action is good, and the world building is interesting. There is far less humor in it than his Tao books. That's probably appropriate given the world he's built, but the humor was one of the best parts of those books for me.<br/><br/>For some reason though, I just never was in a rush to pick it back up, which is part of why it took me so long to read it. I suspect if I had different expectations going in, or on a reread I'll like this one a bit more. <br/><br/>I do plan to pick up the sequel. Things end in a pretty awful place. I want to know what happens next. It's always hard to stop books in a series.

Maybe this will change in later books, or the movie itself.<br/><br/>I found the new characters largely forgettable. I also was largely uninterested in their stories. I probably liked Jazz the bounty hunter the best of the bunch.

He's a believable character, but he's so unlikable that I found his chapters sometimes frustrating to read. Thankfully though his story line was pretty interesting and Mr. Chu did a good job at making me wish for bad things to happen to him.<br/><br/>Overall this book seems to do a good job distinguishing itself from a lot of other sci-fi books out there. Part Spy Thriller, part alien invasion story. Well written and good humor and dialogue. There is a lot to enjoy here and I recommend checking out this series.",,,1,,,1,2014/04/26,Amazon,unspecified,,

Part of the problem was probably always contrasting it to Edward Norton. That's not Mr. Colby's fault though. This is one of those that's fine in audio, but nothing special.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I was tempted to make my review the single line of the “The first rule of fight club is you don’t talk about fight club” but I’m sure that’s been done before and of course I’m not as funny or as clever as I’d like to think I am sometimes. That didn’t stop me from using that or the Jack joke as status updates though..<br/><br/>I think it’s hard to write a review about this book without talking about the movie. For me, it’s impossible, especially since I read this for the first time so many years after the movie came out. Fight Club was one of those movies that blew my mind the first time I saw it. There was nothing like it. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve seen it now. It’s probably right up there with The Matrix as one of the defining movies of my teenage years.<br/><br/>So I was a bit apprehensive about reading the book. I’ve actually owned the audio book for a few years from some kind of sale or daily deal, but kept avoiding it in favor of other things. Typically the book is always better than the movie, so of course I should love the book right?<br/><br/>The thing is for me, part of the brilliance of the movie was in the big reveal. The second time through the movie there were all these little things to catch that I totally missed the first time, that made me love the movie even more. But the 3rd time? The tenth? So I’m coming into this book seeing Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf in my head.<br/><br/>In the end, I liked the book, but I probably like the movie better. It's a pretty faithful adaptation actually. Nothing in the book really stuck out to me as missing from the movie. I'm sure there are some differences I missed, especially given the length differences, but I felt like I was getting the same story.<br/><br/>For me, personally, I'm going to grab my copy of the movie before I grab my copy of the book the next time I want to enjoy Fight Club, but I'm glad I finally read it.",,,1,,,1,2014/01/16,Audible,Like new,,

If you enjoyed the movie, you'll probably enjoy this book. It's full of cameos that don't really need to happen, but you just love to see them anyways if you're already a fan.<br/><br/>This book may be approachable to someone new to Veronica Mars, but I doubt they will get as much out of it. It probably got an extra star from me simply for being a Veronica Mars book with all the characters that come with, rather than ""Jane Private Eye"". If I wasn't already a fan, I know I wouldn't have picked this up.<br/><br/>I never cared as much about the Logan vs. Piz thing. That's certainly downplayed here. So if you were hoping for more of that, you may be disappointed. You get a fair bit of Mac, Wallace, and Keith. Also Sheriff Lamb. Pretty much everyone else is relegated to cameos.<br/><br/>The book seems to takes up right after the movie. So if you haven't already watched the TV series and the movie, I'm not sure if a lot of this will make sense.<br/><br/>The actual story itself is about on par with one of the episodes. Obviously compared to an episode or even the movie, this is much longer. As a result, You get a lot of extra ""world building"" I think the series transitions well to the page, and this seems like a smart idea to ride the momentum and fandom after the movie. <br/><br/>I've never really been a reader of mystery books, but I will likely keep reading these if they keep releasing them.

It's a 3.5 stars, and I should round it down to 3 just for that reason, but I love Veronica Mars and I want them to make more books. I just want Kristen Bell back!<br/><br/><b>Audio book:</b> Ms. Lowman was given an impossible task. It would have been hard enough if they hired her for book 1. The book series is based on a TV show with well known and beloved characters. Those characters already have voices.<br/><br/>But to make her job worse, they hired Kristen Bell to do the audio of the first book. And she killed it. Not only because she <i>is</i> Veronica Mars, but she did an awesome job with the other voices as well.<br/><br/>So when I saw Kristen Bell wasn't doing this one, I was furious. Ms. Lowman might normally be a fine narrator for other books. I have too hard of a time making a fair assessment. I'm just still too mad it's not Kristen Bell.<br/><br/>I really it was a one time thing, and they bring Kristen Bell if they do a 3rd book. If not, they are probably going to lose my interest.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>So this book, much like the last one has a lot of fan service, and spends some time world building adding some interesting new plot points to the world of Veronica Mars.<br/><br/>Fans of Logan should be happy that you get more of him in this book, than you did in the last, but it's still mostly Veronica, Mac, Wallace, and Keith. This one also gives us a lot more Weevil.<br/><br/>Once again this is a fun book (or as fun of a book as it can be given the subject matter). I love spending times with Veronica and company, and think that the novels are a great idea that Rob Thomas should have come up with sooner.<br/><br/>This series has never been shy about discussing rape, it's been central to Veronica's character, and a plot point on the show in more than one occasion. I think it's once again handled well, though I'm probably not the right person to make those kinds of judgement calls.<br/><br/>This once again feels like an extended episode with lots of cameos and world building that should appeal to Veronica Mars fans, but probably won't do much for people new to the series.<br/><br/>Overall, still pretty enjoyable, and I'll probably pick up the next one if they put one out. I just hope they get Kristen Bell back, or I may switch to reading it.",,,1,,,1,2015/01/09,Review Copy,Like new,,

I'm too much of a lightweight to keep up with them. But I sure do seem to love reading about them.<br/><br/>As a long time D&D player this story just seemed to press all the right buttons for me.

I've seen comments about realistic body images, and I can't really speak too much to that, but I have watched plenty of anime and read many comics with unrealistic body images, so I can say the characters seem more realistic to me. And of course they are wearing proper armor for their class and not the standard +10 bra of super defense.<br/><br/>But more importantly (to me anyways) the artwork is really excellent in general.

I might never have discovered it otherwise.<br/><br/>The fact that I read this book, rather than waiting for the audio book to come out should be a good indication as to how I excited I was for it. My reading time is precious and my reading speed poor. I made sure to clear my schedule so I'd be able to jump right into this on release day.<br/><br/>The book starts with a bang. Literally. It pulls you right in and your off and running. Unfortunately I found it got a bit bogged down in the middle due to many additional POVs and sub plots. I struggled a bit, and my reading pace slowed down. This wasn't helped by a weekend trip, which is often when I do most of my reading.<br/><br/>Thankfully Mr. Naam does a good job tying all of these stories together in a meaningful way. The last 20% or so was impossible to put down and I devoured it at a record pace.<br/><br/>Apart from the pacing issues in the middle, my main complaint remains the same as for the previous books. I feel like the side effects of Nexus are completely neglected. This isn't ""hard"" sci-fi by any means, but Mr. Naam does a great job of keeping things in the realm of plausibility.<br/><br/>I was excited to see some mention that the long term effects of the drug were going to be studied, but then nothing else was mentioned, and the concept was never explored. I struggle with the idea that apart from the variance during the initial ""calibration"" phase there is no difference from person to person and the drug and Operating System just seems to work flawlessly for everyone.<br/><br/>Is this due to the Operating System being able to handle difference in brain chemistry? We see differences in capabilities of people who were exposed to the drug while their brains are still developing. Young children do better than adults, but are still not as adapt as those children exposed in the womb.<br/><br/>Too much detail would have likely bogged the story down, but I hope if Mr. Naam revisits this world in a future novel these ideas are explored in greater detail.<br/><br/>That said, much like the other books in this series, this book is a lot of fun that leaves you thinking about it long after you put it down. I wasn't really sure how things would end up, but I think it was done in such a way that I'd be content if this was the last book about Nexus Mr. Naam wrote.<br/><br/>The characters are excellent as in the previous novels. Mr. Naam offers a variety of ideas and opinions through a diverse and interesting cast of characters, where even the minor characters feel well developed. <br/><br/>Rangan's story ended up being the one I was most interested in. This was followed closely by Yuguo. I guess because they were the closest to the various protests going on, this put them on the ""front lines"" so to speak.<br/><br/>Sadly, much like the last novel, I found Sam to be a bit underutilized. This is likely a result of all the new POVs added. That isn't to say this book is hurting for female characters however. I especially enjoyed the addition of Carolyn Pryce, who plays a prominent role throughout the novel.<br/><br/>And of course, Feng continues to be a favorite, adding some great humor into what is often a dark story. <br/><br/>After reading this series, I will definitely be on the lookout for Mr. Naam's next book. If you're looking for something new and different, you should really give this series a look.",,,1,,,1,2015/05/05,Amazon,unspecified,,

Now whenever I try a new Urban Fantasy series I find myself wishing I was simply rereading the Dresden Files.<br/><br/>I always get people telling me, if you like Dresden you'll like <i>insert series name here</i>. They just never hold up. I usually find myself bored after one book or two. <br/><br/>This one wasn't amazing or anything, but I didn't find myself thinking too much about Dresden while I was listening to it. It somehow seemed to be it's own thing, and not just another Dresden clone, despite the fact that is is another detective magician series.<br/><br/>I suspect if I had the first clue about London, this book would easily be 4 stars. There are probably lots of subtleties that just went over my head. But Mr. Aaronvitch seems to not only bring the city of London alive, but makes it an integral part of the story itself.<br/><br/>The original title for this book is Rivers of London, and it's very fitting. I don't really get why they changed the title for the US. I guess I can see where the new title came from, but it seems far less appropriate than the original.<br/><br/>It's probably because I love the whole magic school/apprentice thing. Peter Grant isn't exactly a young boy who is clueless, but he has a lot to learn and I always find myself enjoying learning about a new world through the eyes of a student.<br/><br/>It also helped its cause with me by not being focused on Vampires, Werewolves or Zombies. I'm pretty sick of all those things. I don't mind them being in the mix, but I hope future books don't focus on them too much.<br/><br/>I'm most interested in the unique aspects of the world building. I want to learn more about the Rivers and how seemingly ordinary people can be come powerful enough to be worshiped like gods.<br/><br/>I hope he continues to focus on that with future books as well as adding in some other unique ideas to set this series apart from the overabundance of uninteresting Urban Fantasy that just doesn't seem to do anything for me.

However as this is a fantasy book based in current time and involves using computers to manipulate the world to <i>pretend</i> to be a wizard this seems like a big flaw for me.<br/><br/>Mr. Meyer has a plausible reason to explain away his lack of female characters, but he could have just as easily had a plausible reason for their inclusion instead.<br/><br/>Overall though, I really enjoyed listening to this book and I'll be on the lookout for his next book as well as planning to check out his webcomic in the near future.",,,1,,,1,,,Like new,,

I'd love to see more stories in this world. If not with Quentin as his friends, then maybe with other students at Brakebills. Preferably ones I like much sooner. <br/><br/>I found Plumb a nice addition to the series, much as I did Poppy in the last book. It was nice to see that much like the real world, not everyone is so depressed and cynical all the time.<br/><br/>Overall I've found this an enjoyable series, which is likely obvious from how quickly I tore through it.

This book is well written. Part mystery, part fantasy, with some pretty good humor. More ""urban"" fantasy than traditional fantasy, or maybe this could be considered ""flintlock"". The subgenre doesn't really matter too much though. It's more important to get across that this book feels very fresh and pretty light on fantasy tropes.<br/><br/>Mr. Bennett paints a rich and deep world, especially for a stand alone book of only 450 pages. The little bits of text from various fictional books really helped to flush things out in a short amount of text. And unlike Malazan these were cryptic entries that really only make sense to a rereader, but were at worst something to file away for later in the book, but usually for later in that chapter.<br/><br/>And if world building doesn't do much for you, then there are the characters. The main character, Shara, is a 30 something intelligent women who uses his brains rather than a weapon to do most of her fighting. However when violence is called for her ""secretary"", Sigrud is there to handle it. In many ways Sigrud almost steals the show, but that's really just because he like a few of the other supporting characters are so strong.<br/><br/>And if characters and cool world building aren't enough, there is a pretty interesting ""magic"" system, that's tied in well with the aforementioned world building.<br/><br/>The last thing I want these days is another series to read. This book is definitely stand alone, but I would totally read another book set in this world, and it sounds like I may get that.

He does voices for all the characters and really adds to Mr. Sullivan excellent story telling.<br/><br/>It's for that reason that despite dropping a substantial amount of money on the kickstarter for this book, and having early access to the ebook version (and a hardcover version on the way), I still waited for and bought the audio version. <br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I was a little apprehensive about this book. Mr. Sullivan has been working on his First Empire series for the last few years, and suddenly discovered that if he didn't publish a Riyria book by the end of the year, he wouldn't be able to do so for at least another or year or two. He did a kickstarter in order to get it out on time and seems to have written the whole thing in only a few months.<br/><br/>I should have known better. Mr. Sullivan really knows these characters well and always writes an entertaining story. It's fun to be back with Royce and Handrian. It's interesting to see how the characters have changed and grown in the original series from how they used to be. Royce has become more like Hadrian and vice-versa.<br/><br/>It's also a lot of fun to see how certain details originally came to light. There are some great nuggets in here for people who have read the original series already. I know Mr. Sullivan has tried to make an effort to make it possible to read the prequels first, but after this book, I'm not sure that's still true. I've always recommended publication order anyways, but now I'll actively recommend against reading the prequels first too. I think some of the things here will ruin their revelations (see what I did there?) in the original series.<br/><br/>Mr. Sullivan's writing is great, and the plotting is tight. He seems to mix humor, action and intrigue effortlessly. Despite knowing a lot of about the future of these characters, he was still somehow able to leave me guessing about what will happen next. <br/><br/>He largely accomplishes this by adding some excellent supporting characters. I think both Lady Dulgath and Scarlet Dodge are great additions to the world. That said, it's the banter between Royce and Hadrian that really steals the show for me. This goes double for the audio. Mr. Reynolds does such a great job bringing it to life.<br/><br/>Overall this another solid Riyria book. It's fun and light, in a genre that seems overrun with serious dark fantasy most of the time. If you haven't checked out Riyria yet, I highly recommend you do, starting with [b:Theft of Swords|10790290|Theft of Swords (The Riyria Revelations, Vol 1)|Michael J.

Or 90 minutes as the case may be.<br/><br/>A bit of a strange job for a pair of thieves leads to a rather amusing story. While it won't be as legendary as some of their other capers, it's still a good story to share over a pint of ale at Rose and Thorn.

With this entry I'm a bit torn.<br/><br/>The major plot points were immediately apparent to me fairly early on. Why? Well I had heard about them before as background during the Revelations series. There are some major details that will likely escape readers starting with Chronicles first, or at best be unconfirmed suspicions that won't be confirmed until they read Revelations however. This adds some depth to the story that might otherwise be missing.<br/><br/>So how does a ""predictable"" book get a 4 star rating? Well I really love Mr. Sullivan's characters for one, and it's great to get to spend more time with them. Not only are Royce, Hadrian and Gwen back, but we get to see Arista, Aldric and the Pickerings as kids in this one. Not to mention everyone's ""favorite"" grandfatherly character, Bishop Saldor.<br/><br/>Mr. Sullivan once again promotes a minor character from the original series to a POV in the prequel series. This time it's Hillfred, who himself is a boy just on the verge of becoming a palace guard. That detail alone should give veteran Riyria readers an idea of many of the major plot points of this book.<br/><br/>Like [b:The Crown Tower|16043804|The Crown Tower (The Riyria Chronicles #1)|Michael J. Sullivan|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1375570227s/16043804.jpg|21821161], we get a much darker Royce who hasn't been tempered by 15 years in Hadrian's company. Maybe it's my grimdark fandom that leads me to somehow enjoy this version of Royce even more than I did during Revelations. Still this book is far from the grit and gruesomeness of Abercrombie or Martin, despite possibly being the darkest book of the series.<br/><br/>A problem with prequels is you know when something bad happening is inevitable, because it already has. You can only sit back and wait for it.<br/><br/>Like [b:The Crown Tower|16043804|The Crown Tower (The Riyria Chronicles #1)|Michael J.

He avoids major spoilers with clever dialogue that will have Revelations readers shaking their heads knowingly that first time readers will likely miss completely.<br/><br/>I for one hope that he will continue writing these Riyria stories as I'm already sad to have burned through all 8 stories so quickly.",,,1,Riyria Fans,,1,2013/10/19,Audible,Like new,,

This book did start slow, and had me worried a bit, but once it got going it was really enjoyable and makes for a great addition to the series.<br/><br/>Mr. Sullivan says he made it a point to allow readers to choose their entry point, and I think he makes a good effort at it. I had a friend read this book first and he enjoyed it and wasn't confused.<br/><br/>However, try as he will there are some things I'd consider spoilers in this book, which is pretty much inevitable with a prequel. They may only be minor things and I tend to be overly sensitive about that kind of thing. Either way I think you'll get more out of this book having read the original series first.

Sullivan|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1313141264s/4345290.jpg|21574260]<br/><br/>So on to the book. There are two main POVs for most of this book: Hadrian and <s>Royce</s> Gwen? I was a bit surprised about the Gwen story as I didn't know much coming in. The start of her story is a large part of why I found the start of this book slow. It was worth it in the end however. <br/><br/>Once her story got going I found it really interesting, and made for a nice contrast from Hadrian's story which was almost entirely devoid of woman. Gwen was an interesting minor character in the original series, and it's fun to see her promoted here.<br/><br/>Hadrian's story starts a bit slow as well, but not as much and I did enjoy the character of Pickles a lot.

But it could easily be applied to the previous ELEVEN books in the series. I get that this series won't be for everyone, but why have you read 12 books if you just don't think it's that good? Oh well people are entitled to their opinions.<br/><br/>I have a guilty pleasure for bad movies, especially martial arts movies. The quality of these books are much better than that in my view, but at it's core it's the equivalent of a popcorn flick. <br/><br/>They are a great interlude for some of the heavier stuff I stuff I've been reading, especially among the rise of all the grimdark fantasy lately.

I decided after enjoying an audio re-read of Harry Potter and the Dark Tower, that Dresden Files might be a good choice next.<br/><br/>It's really amazing to see how far Jim Butcher has come as a writer, and how far Harry Dresden has evolved as both a character and a Wizard.

Mr. Butcher begins the building blocks of what looks to be an interesting world, with a great set of characters, none better than Harry Himself. <br/><br/>Harry is a wizard. The only one listed in the phone book. He's not very successful and therefore has a lot of money issues. His specialty is finding things. His best source of income is as a consultant for Chicago Police on the strange cases that can't be explained by normal circumstances. <br/><br/>His contact is Lt. Karen Murphy, head of a division of the police tasked with solving the unsolvable and strange cases. Lt. Murphy is a great indicator of the strong female characters Mr. Butcher is able to write.<br/><br/>As this is a noir-style novel, there are some stereotypical female characters, but Lt. Murphy doesn't fit that mold. Tough and determined, she doesn't take crap from anyone, least of all Harry. In your standard story this role would be played by some grizzled old male cop, not a short, young female.<br/><br/>Most of the story is pretty boiler plate. There is a series of strange murders Harry is called in to investigate. Meanwhile he's finally caught a client who wants her to find her husband. Somehow the local mob are involved and everyone is suddenly gunning for Harry.<br/><br/>The best thing going for these early stories is that Mr. Butcher seems to know how to keep things short. He's doesn't fluff the story out. The book finishes pretty strong and left me wanting more, which is usually the best sign of a good book for me.",,,3,Everyone,,1,,,unspecified,,

This follows the events of the first book, but could nearly be read stand alone apart from references back to it.<br/><br/>The story is split in two alternating stories. The first story is about an artificial intelligence, Lovelace, that was created to serve about a ship, but now finds herself in a human analogue. The other story is about the past of Pepper, the technician whom we met as a minor character in the original book.<br/><br/>Pepper did not have an easy childhood. Lovelace is not having an easy time of her new situation. That made this book a bit harder to read than the first. I enjoyed the first part, but the fun of the first book was missing. I found Lovelace's parts slow at the start as well.<br/><br/>As the book went on though, I was just as caught up in it as I was in Long Way. This was a very different book, but it was still an interesting story to be told. The main theme of the book, if I had to pick one is what does it mean to be alive/sentient? What things make us all the same? How can we  come to understand and accept the differences of others?<br/><br/>Some might think that is preachy. I know I read criticism of the first book with that complaint. For me though, it's what sci-fi has done for years. Evaluate big ideas in a futuristic and imagined future.

I loved learning about the world, and in particular how people and their demons interact. I think the demon aspect is what interested me most.<br/><br/>In some ways this is a fantastical alternative history story. It feels like early 1900's in England as far as locations and technology go, but where everyone has a demon and their are talking bears and air ships.<br/><br/>I'm certainly not the target audience here, but that's never stopped me with other well written books aimed at younger audiences. I like Lyra right away from the start, but as the book went on, I liked her less. She's a kid, and she acts like one, but that wasn't my issue I don't think. In particular it's that's she seems to lie almost constantly in order to get ahead, and it always works. Or so it felt like to me.<br/><br/>I wasn't particularly excited by the bears either. I should have been, and maybe as a kid I'd be enamored, but I just kind of found them uninteresting for some reason.<br/><br/>Then there is the magic compass itself. It's a cool idea, and I'd love to have one. However, I felt like it was overused by the author as a convenient plot device to move the story alone and make everything a lot easier on Lyra. She didn't have to be clever or figure anything out on her own, she just needed to consult the compass for what to  do and then lie and lie BIG.<br/><br/>That all may make it sound like I didn't like the book.

I like his ideas, but his execution at times can come across as juvenile to me. I've enjoyed a few of his books, and downright loathed a few others. The start of this book felt that way to me, and made it feel slow and had me concerned I wasn't going to like it.<br/><br/>Thankfully things picked up pretty quickly and I was sucked back into it. One of my main issues with the first few books was Kip. He still has his moments, but thankfully his character has grown to a point where I enjoy his parts of the story apart from the initial bit. <br/><br/>I think all four of the main POVs were interesting though, and there was never a feeling of disappointment when the POV would switch to someone else. Tia continues to be a favorite of mine, and Karis seems a lot more cunning than she has in previous books.<br/><br/>We get a lot of great world building, both in terms of history and with regards to the excellent magic system that kept my interest despite my misgivings at time. The political intrigue is also quite well done. None of the antagonists feel like cartoon characters anymore and that makes for much better story telling in my opinion.<br/><br/>As a side note the book came with a 15 minute recap of the first three books which I really appreciated. There were also some good refresher moments throughout that all helped to jog my memory and enjoy the book more.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say this is probably the second best book of the series so far, and really set things up nicely for what will hopefully be the final book.

I had different expectations coming into this book but I still found this book taking different turns than I expected it to. This time that was mostly a good thing.<br/><br/>The time spent on Earth helped to fix problems with plot and characters I had in the first book. I still find myself wanting some more details about what's going on Earth than we're given though. That runs contrary to my desire for a space-based military sci-fi novel, but since so much time was spent focused on Earth in the first book, I was hoping more answers would be forthcoming.<br/><br/>The writing is solid, and the character development is improved over the last book as well. I'm a lot more fond of the characters in this book than the last. Not only the protagonist Andrew Grayson, but pretty much all of the returning supporting characters as well. I think we get more depth to their personalities making them far more likable. I still found myself scratching my head at times over character actions in the book though.<br/><br/>That said, this is a pretty fast-paced and fun military story, so I'm not really expecting some sprawling complex world building.

I'm not a huge military fiction fan, but I like  space opera and I was hoping to get some of that here.<br/><br/>Since those were my expectations coming in, I found the first two thirds a bit underwhelming. We start in a near future Earth. Things are bleak. The planet is in bad shape and we've begun colonizing other worlds. Spots on colony ships are hard to come by. Many people are living in welfare funded slums.<br/><br/>The protagonist joins the military in an attempt to escape his life. We get a pretty generic and mostly forgettable boot camp story arc. Then I think even more than our protagonist, I'm super disappointed that he's staying on earth. The middle arc is never really explained though it is at least more interesting than the first arc.<br/><br/>Finally in the third arc things start to pick up. It was here that the book really started to grab my interest. Now that we have the space opera type story I was hoping for when I first picked up this book, I was finally enjoying it.<br/><br/>The world building is pretty bleak. You can tell the author has a military background. It also seems to me he has a very low opinion of poor people, especially those on welfare. I found myself conflicted at times between the protagonist's plight and the supposed antagonists during the middle arc. None of it was very well explained though. Maybe if it had, I would have been less conflicted. The protagonist isn't always likable initially, but he grew on me as the story went on. <br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this book, and it got better as it went on.

My first gaming platform was an Apple IIgs in the late 80s. That was replaced by a Nintendo in the early 90's and that was my platform of choice until I got my first PC in the mid 90s. I'd visit an arcade on occasion, but I never really had the money to play a lot of video games, so home gaming has made up most of my experience.<br/><br/>I never played Atari. All of the early days of Atari was brand new and pretty interesting to me.  I really liked the stuff about arcade games as well. That said, I felt like the early part of the book focused entirely too much on Atari. This book as a whole is told from an American perspective, so any involvement of Japan mostly is covering the impact of Japanese companies on the US gaming market. I'd have liked more history of Japanese companies than we got. I'd also have liked more detail on the other companies involved in the early days of video games.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint was how little Computer Gaming was covered. Sure the Apple II and Commodore 64 were mention. So was Doom. He made brief mention of how some third party publishers were focusing on Computer Games, but mostly as part of the story of how they were lured to make console games. Blizzard wasn't mentioned at all. Apart from the mention of Doom, id was ignored. Sierra Online, who was a huge part of my childhood barely got mentioned.<br/><br/>My final complaint is this book relied too heavily on quotes. It's hard to say for sure since I did audio, but it felt like half of each chapter was simply quotes of people in the industry. I don't really need quotes. I need the author to interview and research and present a narrative to me. The occasional quote to drive a point is fine.<br/><br/>All that said, I enjoyed this book. I've read a lot of books on early computers and a few things on video games in particular and this book covers a good range of detail from the 1970s until the late 90s. <br/><br/>If you're particularly interested in American Console game video game history, this is a good choice. However it's far from the Ultimate history simply because too many things I feel were important to the rise of video games in not only the United States, but the entire world were badly neglected.",,,1,,,1,2016/08/28,Audible,Like new,,

That was amped up even more after Ms. Jemisin won a well deserved Hugo. This series is unlike anything else I've read in fantasy, and I thank her for it. Over the years I tend to favor fantasy books with cool magic systems and lots of action. This series is almost the opposite of that. <br/><br/>There is an interesting magic system that important to the plot, but the plot largely deals with how people are treated in society when they are different. Discrimination based on race, gender or sexual preference are still far too common today, yet they don't tend to show up in fantasy. Not to mention that the characters are often all entirely white. Science Fiction has a long tradition of evaluating not only the possibilities of science, but as a commentary on present day society. Why not fantasy?  Ms. Jeminsin manages to do this while telling a very interesting and engaging story.<br/><br/>I still love my high action magic fight books, but a book like this tends to stick with me a lot longer. It's the kind of book you think about even when you're not reading it. That's hard to do, especially at a time when we're being inundated with amazing new stories in the form of books, games, TV and the occasional movie. With so much vying for our attention, it can be hard to be memorable. This series easily does that so far.<br/><br/>One of the things I loved best about [b:The Fifth Season|19161852|The Fifth Season (The Broken Earth, #1)|N.K. Jemisin|https://d2arxad8u2l0g7.cloudfront.net/books/1386803701s/19161852.jpg|26115977] was how the story was told. We had three different POV stories that tied very well together by the end of the book, but what would Ms. Jemisin do here? I found her choices of story telling to work nearly as well. Essun's story continues on in the second person, a form I pretty much haven't encountered since English class. Most of the rest of the story is told from a new POV and I found that story complements Essun's quite well.<br/><br/>That said, I didn't enjoy this quite so much as the first one. There were a few slower parts, and at times it felt like things was being set up for the final book. In other words a bit of ""middle book syndrome"".

It then goes into a lot of background about the dissident group (called the O.A.S) and France in the 1960s. Charles de Gaulle survived six assassination attempts, which is pretty crazy. I can see why Mr. Forsyth chose him/France as his backdrop. I probably wouldn't have appreciated the politics without all the background, but I still found it on the slow side.<br/><br/>In general, I found some parts of the book far too detailed for my liking.

He's got the perfect voice for Bill Hodges, but he does an excellent job with the supporting characters as well. This is definitely one of those I think is better in audio.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>Murder stories are far too popular. If comic books are dominating the movie theater, murder shows are the thing of choice for TV. At least network TV anyways. I got tired of it, and so I wasn't sure how much I'd like a detective murder mystery.<br/><br/>However there are very few Stephen King books that I've read that I haven't enjoyed to some degree. He writes fantastic characters that always jump off the page for me. Bill Hodges is pretty good. However for me the real star is Holly Gibney. She's probably in my top 5 favorite Stephen King characters. Considering the iconic characters Mr. King has written over the years, that's really saying something. This series wouldn't be the same without her. The interaction between her and Bill are especially excellent.<br/><br/>Without getting into spoiler territory, I wasn't really sure where this third book would be going after how things were left in the second one. Turns out Mr. King had a plot device ready to go to move the story forward. I was initially not very happy with it, but I came to accept it by the end. I'm not sure what I might have preferred as an alternative, but after awhile I was too caught in the story to really care that much.<br/><br/>There are several other returning characters in this book I was happy to see again, the top being Jerome Robinson, but especially compared to previous book it's nice to have a book where I like so many of the characters.<br/><br/>Not all of them are likable though. However even the antagonists of the book are fascinating to follow around (at least between cringes). I think Mr. King puts some of the worst thoughts and actions of humanity on display here. It gives it a sense of realism that had me glad this was fiction. <br/><br/>Thankfully the overall message I got out of this book is one of optimism. This book deals a lot in suicide, and highlights many of the reasons people may choose to take their own life. It's a dark topic, but I think he does a good job at combating that with people who love and care one another.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed this book and this series, and it's bittersweet to be done with it. I want another book (or three) with Holly Gibney. Prequel, sequel, side story. I don't care Maybe she can make an appearance or two in some of his other works like some of his other characters have. I just know I'm going to miss her like she's someone I'm friends with rather than a character in a book, which is always a sign of a great character. I look forward to seeing what Mr. King has in store for us next.",,,1,,,1,2016/06/08,Review Copy,Like new,,

As my rare five star rating would indicate, I really enjoyed this one too. Mr. Wexler is setting the bar extremely high for the final book next year.<br/><br/>Four books into this series, and it continues to delight. Much like the previous book it struck the right balance between politics and military action to keep me constantly engaged. It's a book I always hated to stop each day and looked forward to getting back to. That's usually my main criteria to push a solid 4 or 4.5 star book to the rare 5 star rating.<br/><br/>At first blush, you might see this series and think it's just another military fantasy series. However the early books always felt more like low fantasy to me, and even these later books don't revolve entirely around the magic. <br/><br/>What makes this series so great is the characters. Winter Ihernglass has probably become one of my all time favorites. And if Winter wasn't great enough, there is both Raesinia and Marcus. However I think more than anything is the supporting characters. It's hard to make a reader care about your protagonists. It's even harder to make them care about the secondary characters, who often don't get the kind of depth as the POV characters. I love them all, and worry constantly anytime they are threatened.<br/><br/>This book really ramps up the stakes and set the stage for the fifth and final book, while still managing to come to a satisfactory stopping point.

I want to see the play, but that's not practical. I'd have loved a novel, but paying to read the script of a play? Was this just a money grab? Maybe I'd wait and see what other people thought. <br/><br/>Who was I kidding? I ended up buying it and nearly reading it all in one sitting. I really enjoyed it. I loved getting to visit with the old characters again. It was like catching up with old friends. The new characters were really good too. I especially like Scorpio Malfoy. He was probably my favorite of the kids.<br/><br/>Ms. Rowling has already come out and said she won't be writing anymore adult Harry Potter books, but how about books about the kids in this book? There is a lot of room for more stories in the world, and I hope that we may get some, probably now much more than before this play was released.<br/><br/>I'll be curious to see what kind of reaction this gets. It's not the eighth Harry Potter book. It's a play with the characters from the Harry Potter books. It's incredibly short compared to a novel. It wasn't written by Ms. Rowling either. Those are all important things to keep in mind before picking this up. Maybe that's why Ms. Rowling didn't want to write the novel. The seven books stand on their own, and always will.<br/><br/>However the same magic I felt when reading those books was there for me. I suspect it may not be the same for others though. These books seem almost universally loved (at least I haven't met anyone whose read them than didn't enjoy them). I'm sure those people exist, but I suspect this will be a lot more divisive than that.<br/><br/>All I can say is for me personally, I'm glad I picked this up, and I'll probably read it again at some point, but not nearly as many times as I've read the original novels. It's a nice addition to the world of Harry Potter for me, but it's not quite the same as getting an eighth book. <br/><br/>Now if anyone has some kind of magic ability to score tickets to the play some point in my lifetime, I'll trade you all the gold I have in Gringotts..",,,1,,,1,2016/07/31,Amazon,unspecified,,

The pie eating contest story was alright, but I can't even remember what the second story was about. That goes to show how unimportant it was to the overall plot.<br/><br/>I never had anything remotely close to the experiences of these four boys growing up, but that doesn't make it feel any less real to me.

The killer murdered a crowd of people, including a baby using a big stolen Gray Mercedes. They are a lot of psychological elements as both cop and criminal attempt to out think one another.<br/><br/>While the majority of the story is told from Retired Detective Bill Hodges point of view, we are also given numerous chapters told from the killer's perspective as well.<br/><br/>The story itself is nothing that special. Where this book shines (as usual) is in the characters. Mr. King always seems to write the most realistic and interesting characters. They aren't necessarily someone you'd want to hang out with or even know, but they are the type that make it hard to look away (or in this case stop listening to the book).<br/><br/>Holly and Jerome are both memorable characters to add depth to the duel between our retired detective and the killer who got away.

Most of what I've read have ties to <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/series/40750-the-dark-tower"">The Dark Tower</a>. This book is mentioned somewhere in the series. It seems like the Overlook Hotel might be competing with The Crimson King's Low Men for Danny. He'd probably be a hell of a breaker.<br/><br/>I'm not much of a horror fan, but Mr. King is one of my favorite authors. Why? Well most of what I've read by him tends to overlap into the fantastical. This one is no different. The book centers around the evil Overlook Hotel, which is very much so a character in it's own right (or more accurately, several characters). <br/><br/>I'm intrigued by the history of the hotel. There have been a series of dark events that have been mostly covered up by the ownership and the management. Are the owners purposefully helping the hotel to continue to claim new victims? It kind of seems that way.<br/><br/>The other reason I love Mr. King's books is his characters. I didn't really like any of the Torrance family. Jack is an alcoholic with anger issues, Wendy is neurotic, and Danny is kind of creepy. If you watch the movie, you might think that's all there is to the characters.<br/><br/>The book goes deeper. Jack's father was also an angry drunk. Wendy's mom gives her cause to be neurotic and that's before she married Jack. Danny is still a little creepy, but all of the characters are a bit more sympathetic and certainly more three dimensional.<br/><br/>Jack's decent into madness is more tragic. Wendy's craziness is more understandable.<br/><br/>3.5 Stars rounded up, because: fanboy.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

But I try to read the ones with Dark Tower ties. This one was supposed to have minor connections, but I'd call them easter eggs at best.<br/><br/>What really moved this one up my list was the TV show. I enjoy the show, though if was a Fall show rather than a Summer one, it's possible I would have dropped it already. My main reason for reading the book was to find out the mystery behind the dome before the show revealed it. I needn't have worried though.<br/><br/>Like just about everything else though, the book is better. Not only is it better, it's almost entirely different. The plot seems to diverge from almost the very beginning. Some of the characters are similar, and they used some of the names. Most of them are drastically different though, or severely toned down.<br/><br/>No one will watch the show and think the Rennie's are likable characters by any means, but they have some redeemable characteristics. In the book both of them are downright awful. And they are not the only ones.<br/><br/>Mr. King's strength as a writer to me has always been his characters. They jump off the page. This book has some great ones. Though his best characters here are probably the worst. <br/><br/>Jim Rennie, used car salesman, town selectman, and fervent Christian is absolutely despicable. His ability to do something downright awful and follow it up with prayers for strength to continue to lead the town just show how self delusional some people can really be. And his son is probably worse. Most of the town is behind the Rennie's, or at least willing to blindly follow their lead in this time of crisis.<br/><br/>Thankfully though, there are plenty of likable characters, which will be somewhat similar to anyone familiar with the show. Primarily Dale Barbara, a drifter currently employed as a short order cook at the local diner. And there is Julia Shumway, the owner/editor of the local newspaper. They are rounded out <br/><br/>If you pick this book expecting a supernatural horror story, you may be disappointed. Mr. King doesn't spend a lot of time explaining the how or why of the dome. It mostly serves as the setting and a bit of plot vehicle. The characters want to escape, or use the dome as the reason to do something they might not otherwise.<br/><br/>Forget the fact that there is giant supernatural dome for a minute. The core of this story is really about all the horrible things people will do to one another when given an opportunity to get away with it, or simply not face real consequences.<br/><br/>Mr. King paints a picture of the best and the worst (mostly the worst) of humanity when panic and isolation and puts them under the microscope (or a dome!) for us to see the results.<br/><br/>I'm having a hard time trying to figure out other King book I've read this is most like to say ""if you like <i>book name</i>, you'll probably like this one.""

You have that same sort of isolation and human driven horror with a bit of a supernatural flavor.<br/><br/>My main disappointment with the book was that the ending felt underwhelming. This goes back to the dome not being very flushed out, but merely a plot device. Despite that once I got into this book it was really hard to put down and I kept reading more and more each night until I finally finished it.",,,1,,,1,,,Very good,,

It's been many years now since I read it when it first came out in 2004 (I have a really nice Grant First Edition copy).<br/><br/>I've always felt the first half of the series (1-4) is much stronger than the latter half he wrote in one go after his near death experience. That isn't to say it is bad, or that I'm unhappy.<br/><br/>It might simply be changes to me, and not the series. I started this series in high school, and read and re-read the first four books more times than I can remember while waiting on Mr. King to finish. By the time the story was concluded I was mostly done with college.<br/><br/>On this audio journey, I got to revisit old places and old friends (and enemies) as Roland and his Ka-tet journeyed to the Dark Tower.

One dropped out after just the first book, but the other continued on and seemed to enjoy the series nearly as much as I have.<br/><br/>These days I don't have much time for re-reading.

He's largely considered to be a horror writer, but I've actually read very little of his horror.<br/><br/>I think most King fans would tell that even in his horror books there is a lot of sci-fi and fantasy. Mr. King is not often one to scare you with the realistic (and least we all hope not).<br/><br/>This book is one of the few I've read that has little to nothing to do with the Dark Tower. The combination of sci-fi and time travel had me intrigued.<br/><br/>On that front I was disappointed. This book at it's core is really just a story about Jake Epping, school teacher from (you guessed it) Maine.<br/><br/>He is recruited by his friend (though really he's seem more like a good acquaintance than a friend) Al, and sent on a mission back in time to stop the Kennedy assassination.<br/><br/>As a child of the 80's, the Kennedy assassination doesn't resonate with me as much as I'm sure it does for those who lived it. The ""watershed moment"", as Mr. King likes to call it, of my life thus far was 9/11.<br/><br/>There is some interesting theorizing about the good (and the bad) of what might have happened had Kennedy lived in this book.<br/><br/>There is an interesting explanation of the Time Travel (though it doesn't come till nearly the very end).<br/><br/>The bulk of this story however, is about a man from 2011 living life in the early 1960s. It has very little to do with Kennedy, time travel or the larger ramifications of changing a watershed moment.<br/><br/>I still enjoyed the book, but it just wasn't what I was expecting.",,,1,,,1,,Audible,Brand new,,

I particularly enjoyed meeting additional Reader apprentices beyond Isaac. <br/><br/>Alice is given a chance to shine despite being one of the younger and inexperienced of the group. More than her ingenuity though, Alice has heart. The Reader's don't seem to care about anyone but themselves, not even their own apprentices.

Will Alice build strong bonds with the other apprentices to overcome the animosity between their masters? <br/><br/>For a book aimed as kids, I think Mr. Wexler includes some pretty big ideas, including what it means to be a good person, especially when it is often easier to just care about yourself.<br/><br/>This certainly isn't a book for most people who likely read my reviews, but this series continues to seem like a good one for fantasy fans to share with their kids.",,,1,,,1,2016/04/29,Amazon,Brand new,,

This is especially true for Winter, Janis and Raesinia. He seems to have more diverse and interesting female characters than just about anything else I'm reading these days, and that includes works by female authors.

While I enjoyed both, these series seem to be very different.<br/><br/>Apart from the prologue the first half of this book contained almost no magic at all. There is pretty much just a lot of military protocol and character development. <br/><br/>I'm not a big reader of military fiction in any form, but it is one of the aspects of Malazan Book of the Fallen I'm really enjoying. Unlike that series however there are no medics who use magic to heal or mages who attack with spells here. There are simply soldiers with muskets, bayonets and swords.<br/><br/>I think anyone who finds well described military action boring may be turned away by this one. It really is sort of slice of life with military men for a good portion as Mr. Wexler builds the world and his characters out for the reader.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first half of the story at a solid 3-3.5 rating, but when the fantasy element of this book did finally come along it really raised things to another level for me.<br/><br/>We are provided with two primary point of views that of Captain Marcus d’Ivoire and a soldier named Winter Ihernglass. I liked this contrast between things at the command of the unit and things down at the grunt level.<br/><br/>I think Mr. Wexler also does a good job of swapping between the two while keeping the story flowing, especially in the later chapters where we get both POVs instead of just one of them.<br/><br/>We do get some POVs from the opposing forces in this book, but they are mostly relegated to the prologue, interludes and epilogue. I would have liked to see more from the opposing characters as for now their motivations are vague at best.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure who I'm rooting for in this series. I'm not sure if the goals of the Vordanai and their new commander Colonel Janus bet Vhalnich Mieran are for the best. <br/><br/>I think that's part of the charm of this book. Most fantasy these days operate in shades of grey, but since we're not given much in the way of opposing viewpoints the reader is left to draw their own conclusions about who (if anyone) is in the right here.<br/><br/>Things really pick up at the end and this book comes to a satisfying conclusion while setting things up nicely for the next book, which I'm now looking forward to.",,,1,,Alex Ristea,0,,,,,

Someone whose smart, strong willed and adventurous (albeit reluctantly at first).<br/><br/>I like the choice of a female protagonist. Fantasy is overrun by young male chosen one stories, so it's always a nice change of pace to have a female. <br/><br/>The book follows the apprentice mage trope pretty much, but with a pretty unique magic system that seems well thought out. Being a middle grade book, the rules of the system aren't very flushed out, but that's OK. We learn as our protagonist learns, and I figure more details will become clear as the series goes on.<br/><br/>I also like the choice of setting.

Fewer annoying voices than the first book at least.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>This books starts with a time jump, which I always find tricky. The passage of time can have an important impact on a story. Characters mature, events are put in perspective, plans put into motion. In short: things change. <br/><br/>I'm not always a fan of big time jumps, but Mr. Abraham seems to do a good job of it. We're initially not privy to what the characters have been up to for the last 8 years or so. We discover these things over the course of the book without ever having flashback scenes. That makes me think the time jump was justified.<br/><br/>I found things maybe a little bit slower in this novel than the first one. It took a bit of time for Mr. Abraham to get the pieces in place to finally get the ball rolling, but I never found myself uninterested.<br/><br/>Very few authors can write a sort of everyday life kind of story without boring me. [a:Robin Hobb|25307|Robin Hobb|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1397885202p2/25307.jpg] is incredibly good at this. I think Mr. Abraham is as well. That said, it's the kind of story that can easily turn people away. Once again there is very little magic or action. Almost no fighting at all.<br/><br/>Everything is politically based. There are hints of a possible war on the horizon, but no armies are being mustered yet. I'm hopeful that based on where things stand at the end of this novel, should make for some pretty interesting developments in the next one.<br/><br/>The characters are once again examples of shades of grey. Most are dealing with internal conflicts raging over what course of action they should take. The world he built in the first novel wasn't really expanded much here, but it was refined a little. We get to see the politics and violence of a succession in more detail.<br/><br/>Overall I think anyone who enjoyed the first book, will enjoy this as well. While anyone who found the first book lacking, won't likely find this book any better.<br/><br/>I had the third book all downloaded and ready to go, but unexpectedly got distracted by another book.

I've enjoyed this series so much that now I've caught up and have to wait a year or more for the next and final book. Thankfully unlike some other authors it seems like I won't have to wait too long for the conclusion, and that will definitely be a release day read for me.<br/><br/>Once again this is a very character-driven story that focuses on economics and politics more than magic and battles. There is a lot of fighting going on, but we usually only see the before or the after and very little fighting. <br/><br/>Similarly there is magic, but it's all very hand wavy and not well fleshed out. In fact one of the characters wonders why so many practitioners make their money by doing tricks and aren't utilized in fighting only to be told that conjuring fire isn't nearly as effective in the long term as a bow and arrow.<br/><br/>I liked this book a little less than the last one however. I think it's partially due to Clara's chapters for the first half of the book. She felt more like a camera than an important character. For awhile I was wondering why exactly she was doing what she was, but by the end it made sense and I she might have regained her status as my favorite character.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Marcus's chapters are probably are probably the most interesting. Anyone who finished the last book should be able to guess why that is.<br/><br/>This book really highlights the differences of obtaining power by using military might and money. The title Dagger and Coin was well chosen by Mr. Abraham as we see both approaches to gaining power and attempts to bring about ""peace"" and order.<br/><br/>I really enjoy this series, which should be obvious if you look at how quickly I've listened to it. It's nice to have a fantasy series that feels realistic without being ""grimdark"". Plus I really enjoy the characters and the importance of money not being glossed over or relegated to minor subplot. <br/><br/>If my last 3 reviews haven't convinced you, hopefully this one will to catch up with the series before the final book comes out.",,,1,,,1,2014/08/27,Audible,Like new,,

He's a bit soft spoken, and I wish they had adjusted the volume up a bit to compensate. Overall though, I think audio is an excellent option for this series.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>After reading and falling in love with the Expanse books  a few years ago, I went looking for other books by the authors I might enjoy. I opted to go with this series over his completed Long Price Quartet for some reason, though I ended up reading that too while waiting for this book to come out.<br/><br/>I haven't read another series quite like this one. Most fantasy series completely ignore economics all together and focus on magic and combat. If they do include economic issues they are a minor issue most of the time. Mr. Abraham not only includes economics, but he makes it front and center. Some people might read that and think the story would be boring, but I think Mr. Abraham does an excellent job.<br/><br/>This series at its core is about power. The power of military strength (dagger) and the power of the banks (coin). Through some of the best character development I've ever read, we follow the story of two people on their path to power by very different means.<br/><br/>More than anything, it's the characters and their development that makes this series shine for me. I've never been so conflicted by an antagonist as from this series. Geder's an absolute monster, with largely good intentions. I started out liking him for the most part. He's a bit of a nerd with self esteem issues, something I can identify with. But he's got a really bad temper. Given power, he's quick to make those he feels are laughing at him pay.<br/><br/>Meanwhile you have Cithrin who started out a bit flat and annoying for me, but grew to be a really interesting and complex character. I never really identified with her and her motivations at all, but I always enjoyed reading about them. Through Cithrin, Mr. Abraham made economics pretty interesting for me.<br/><br/>Marcus is on the surface a standard fantasy trope character. The grizzled military veteran haunted by his past. However, Mr. Abraham does a great job giving him depth that elevates him above a mere trope. Some of my favorites bits of dialogue in the whole series are the banter between him and Master Kit, Yardem, or Inys.<br/><br/>My favorite character though has to be Clara. Her development as the series goes on outdoes even Geder's. In a genre that is severely lacking in female characters, Mr. Abraham decides to focus on a 50-something women. She offers a nice contrast to the other characters. She's conflicted about her place in the world, but doesn't let that stop her from accomplishing her goals. She's politically savvy without being unlikable or conniving. She's not quite as good as Avasarala from the expanse, but is definitely a close second.<br/><br/>In addition to the excellent POV characters, the supporting cast was well done too. I'm particularly fond of Yardem, Master Kit and all of the actor company. This world feels large in scope and it's minor characters and a lot of depth to the story.<br/><br/>This book was delayed a few times, likely due to Mr. Abraham's involvement in both the Expanse novels and the TV series. I felt it was worth the wait. The book comes to a decent stopping place, and resolving many of the major conflicts, without wrapping things up in a nice bow. There are still issues to be resolved, but I'm perfectly content leaving them where they are.<br/><br/>And on top of all that, I LOVED the epilogue of the book. It was not only very satisfying, but I felt it offered really nice symmetry with the prologue of [b:The Dragon's Path|8752885|The Dragon's Path (The Dagger and the Coin, #1)|Daniel Abraham|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1292362307s/8752885.jpg|13626110].

While I probably enjoy Dagger & Coin more, I still found this to be quite good.<br/><br/>Since I'm doing this in audio, I struggled badly with the names though. Probably worse than usual. I still really don't know any of the character's names. I wish every audiobook came with a list of character names and their spellings. It would make both my reading and my review writing far easier.<br/><br/>Much like Dagger & Coin, this is pretty much a low fantasy series. There is almost no magic to speak of. One of the characters, Seedless, is a magical construct called an Andat who is a conduit for magic of a practicer who is referred to as a poet. You don't really see much of the magic, and it's not really explained. How exactly the poets are able to do anything isn't clear. It seems to be a struggle of wills with the andat they control.<br/><br/>Mr. Abraham likes focusing on the politics of his fictitious worlds, and this is no different. He has built a world where much of one's emotions and dilogue is actually done through a series of complex hand gestures. It's a society that relies of the power of the poets and condones fratricide among the sons of the rulers as a means of succession.<br/><br/>Young sons are often relegated off to the school that is responsible for cultivating the next generation of poets to save them from being murdered. So you'll never guess who are protagonist it? You guessed it, he's a younger son of one of the city rulers. Go figure.<br/><br/>Overall I found both the world building and the characters to be pretty good/memorable, though less so than his other series. It's going to be hard for me to talk about the characters by name though, since I couldn't tell you what any of them are. I think all the main characters offered depth where no one really felt good or evil. They are just people with desires and faults trying to do what they feel they must for a variety of reasons: values, outside pressures, self interest, fear, etc. I like that sort of characterization. <br/><br/>My favorite character is probably the older 50-something overseer. I wish more SFF novels did this. Abraham seems to have at least one of them in all of his series I've read, and they've all been great. While this one is no Avasarala or even Clara, she is still pretty memorable. Now if only I could tell you her name. :(<br/><br/>The pacing is also a bit slower, especially coming from one of his Expanse books. I don't think it's that much slower than Dagger & Coin.<br/><br/>This pacing, and the general lack of action and fighting may turn some fantasy fans away. If you're looking for military battles, and sword wielding adventurers, you've come to the wrong place.<br/><br/>I however seem to enjoy the more political fantasy novels, so the pacing was never an issue for me. I jumped right into book 2, and will likely finish this whole series pretty quickly.",,,1,,,1,2015/06/10,Audible,Like new,,

It covers a wide range of topics from installation/administration to table design. <br/><br/>The free documentation that comes with Accumulo is pretty good, and always getting better, but it's not really sufficient for someone who is just learning.

The further I get into Accumulo development, the more I'd like to learn about Table and Iterator design. Accumulo Iterators seem complicated enough that they could warrant a book by themselves. They cover some of the more popular table designs, and built in iterators but don't talk too much about custom design. <br/><br/>That will get you pretty far, but it doesn't really help when trying to customize applications to meet your customers needs. Things like query optimizations and how tune your design for performance are only lightly touched on.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is a very good book on Accumulo that is a great compliment to the documentation for both new and experienced Accumulo developers.

The start and the end were both slower than I'd like, but it seemed to really hit its stride in the middle. Overall I didn't find it as funny as his Magic series, but it was still funny at times.<br/><br/>The concept of Master of Formalities guiding the rulers of the galaxy through their rules of etiquette is pretty amusing for a premise. It took a bit longer to set things up than I'd have liked.<br/><br/>The best part for me was the Sports. I don't mean like how football and baseball fall under the category of sports. It's a competition that is apparently the most important thing to the men of Jakabitus home world, while the women focus on more important things, like ruling the planet. The whole thing is just so over the top ridiculous that I found those parts especially enjoyable.<br/><br/>The characters were pretty good, though they did remind me a lot of the characters in his Magic 2.0 series, so maybe that's why. I could draw parallels between most of the main characters to those of that series, but I see little value in that.<br/><br/>Overall, I think if you're hoping for a fourth Magic 2.0 book, you'll be a bit disappointed to have this instead.

His normal reading voice seems more appropriate for this book anyways.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I was reluctant to pick this one up knowing it was both Young Adult, and Romance. I read very little YA, and try to avoid Romance books in general. However, every review I saw about this one was positive. I got caught up in the Star Wars hype with Force Awakens coming out and decided to give it a go anyways.<br/><br/>The general premise of two friends growing up during the events of the original trilogy on opposite sides was appealing. Many of those elements of this book worked really well for me too. I liked the sort of ""boots on the ground"" view of events. <br/><br/>I thought the book was well written. It's always hard to write in someone else's world, especially Star Wars. This one was even harder because the overarching plot was already written and well-known by most if not all the people likely to pick the book up. Ms. Gray does a good job of working her story around notable events of the original trilogy while making it about her characters and not the better known ones. Plus, without getting into spoilers, there were some nice tie-ins to Force Awakens as well.<br/><br/>There are parts of this book I really enjoyed. I liked a pro-empire viewpoint. It offers a nice contrast to what your normally get. The idea that everyone in the empire is evil always seemed too black and white. I really liked the imperial flight school. I wish more time had been spent on the training and classes than the relationship of the protagonists though.<br/><br/>That was my main issue with the book. I just didn't care about the Romance part. I'm the wrong person to ask if it was well done. It's just not my thing. However, I can understand why this book is so popular. I think it's a good thing that Disney/authors are trying to tell new/different kinds of Star Wars stories that might appeal to different audiences.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this was a decent story whose execution didn't work as well for me as it seems to for others.

You could tell it was Mr. Cole's first novel. It felt clunky in places. I also didn't like Oscar Britton very much. That last point might have been intentional by the author though.<br/><br/>I was glad to discover that while this book continues the story of the first, it's largely told from a new viewpoint: Colonel Alan Bookbinder. He's VASTLY more likeable to me. That made a huge difference. It's hard for me to root for a character I don't like and it's hard for me to root against the protagonist.<br/><br/>In addition both the writing and the plot seemed more polished. Many of the events of the first book were in shades of grey. I never knew what I was rooting for half the time. I like that sort of story in general, but the execution frustrated me at times.<br/><br/>This one felt a lot more black and white. There was plenty of conflict Bookbinder had to deal with without him needing to be an asshole about everything. I think if Oscar Britton was more sympathetic to me, it might have worked better. In addition, Bookbinder is a character I can identify with better. While he is a military officer, he's an office worker and an administrator instead of coming from a combat background.<br/><br/>The pace of this book was good. The world building is fairly light though. You get more character development and personal history than you do of an explanation for magic, the source or how the world reached the point it was at.<br/><br/>For a middle book, I found this very enjoyable. Since I'm writing this review after having finished the next one, I can say that it's my favorite of the trilogy. That's pretty rare for me. In fact I can't recall another time where I enjoyed the middle book the most. It does suffer a bit from ""middle book syndrome"" though. It feels a bit transitional at times.<br/><br/>That said, I really enjoyed Bookbinder and his journey from normal office worker to major player in the world of militarized magic.

I haven't liked Harlequin since meeting him in the first book.

Now that's not unusual for me but I used to read a lot more mysteries and thrillers and didn't really get too heavy into fantasy until college.<br/><br/>I solicited some recommendations for non-SFF books to check out with the main criteria being light and fun. Apparently I picked the most ridiculous book to start with first. For me the main attraction was the Indiana Jones vibe/the mentions of Ancient Egypt. I loved Ancient Egypt as a kid. One of the main reasons I got in Stargate was its basis in Ancient Egypt.<br/><br/>This book is fun, don't get me wrong. However the writing was pretty bad. I also had believability issues. Not only in the ""military"" actions of some of the characters, but the politics. I get America is not everyone's favorite country. It's totally understandable. Still I have a really hard time believing that Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Ireland (not the UK) will team up with Spain and the United Arab Emirates against the US. First off that seems a bit random. Second it shows a lack of understanding on the author's part about the nature of the relationship between the major English speaking nations.<br/><br/>Even that aside, I have a really hard time believing any nation, will just casually use soldiers as expendable test subjects for ancient traps. It just seemed silly. It wasn't just the Americans either. There was also the evil Europeans made up of France, Germany and the Vatican. What!? I know this is fiction, but seriously..did this guy not learn any world history growing up? I feel like he made his factions by using darts on a map or something.<br/><br/>Anyways in addition to the bad writing/unbelievable parts, most of the characters felt paper-thin and cartoonish. By the end I just wanted to be done. It's probably why after long thought I'm rounding my rating down.<br/><br/>That said, I did enjoy good chunks of this book. I liked the general premise of the plot, the exploration of ancient tombs/wonders and the various traps they encountered and had to overcome. I bet a better author could have made a really good story out of it.<br/><br/>It's too bad because I had pretty high hopes for this one, and since it's book 1 in a series, I figured I'd have a few to read. I just can't though. This author just apparently isn't for me. Still I'm glad I read the book. It's definitely the type of book I was looking to read.

A psychologist is brought in to  help with a crash that turns out to be a spaceship on the bottom of the ocean. I liked the mystery and investigation aspect of the story, more than the viewpoint of the main character itself though.<br/><br/>As the plot develops and we learn more about not only the ship, but the sphere it contains, I found my mind starting to wander. I didn't get attached to any of the characters. I found myself annoyed by most of the scientists. Several of them seemed to be more concerned about being published and/or their place in history than the actual investigation itself. I've always been more of an engineer than a scientist, but I don't know why anyone would want to deal with that.<br/><br/>As with the other Michael Crichton books I've read, this one takes science and posits some plausible seeming possibilities.

I'm sure it's not a new idea, but I had never encountered a mage's guild with magic doors in various cities, but I totally love that idea, and wish my now bored/retired Wizard had been able to join.<br/><br/>My favorite addition is probably the traveling saleswoman though. Sadly between the audio and my general terrible memory (especially for names), I couldn't tell you her name. She makes a great addition to the already excellent cast of characters of this series.<br/><br/>Two books in, this series is a ton of fun. I have no idea how many more books Mr. Hayes has planned, but I'm eagerly hoping to get another one soon.

It's probably considered hard sci-fi, but I'd put it somewhere between that and space opera. You get into the science a bit at times, but mostly it's about the issues facing a generation ship, and attempting to colonize an alien environment.<br/><br/>There were parts of the story I really enjoyed. I liked Freya acting as our camera as she explored the ship and the different cultures that lived there. I also really liked the middle parts dealing with the colonization stuff, and exploring a new world.<br/><br/>However, things kind of slowed down for me at times throughout, but especially towards the end. I've seen people say this book could have been ended at an earlier point, and get what they mean. I'm not sure if that would have better, or if there had simply been less time spent on the final arc of the book.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked this book and I'm glad I read it. I'll consider picking up another book by Mr. Robinson at some point, but I'm not in a rush to do so.

I don't much care for YA books it seems, and the whole dystopian uprising story has been done to death. The main reason I picked it up was that it was on sale and I really like the narrator.<br/><br/>For the first 33% or so, I felt like my original reluctance was totally justified. I was bored. It felt like paint by numbers. Nothing surprising or interesting happened. At its core there really isn't anything new here. It combines elements of several well known/successful fantasy series, but puts them in a science fiction setting.<br/><br/>Yet despite that, once the real story got started, and all the setup was finally done, I got sucked in. I like the characters, I like the world building, and despite it's rather bleak/dystopian overtones, I found it a lot of fun somehow.

While I enjoyed that story, I just couldn't take the writing and preferred the movies to the books. The writing here could have used some more polish, especially in the first part, but I found it infinitely more readable.<br/><br/>I might file this book under ""guilty pleasure"" reading, except I don't feel guilty. I like reading a book that makes me want to cheer out loud. I like having a character to root for against insurmountable odds. I love to hate when the author makes me angry or sad at a character's mistakes or misfortune. This book had all of that.<br/><br/>It also had an original enough story that caused me to mostly forget about its slow start and sucked me in. I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.

I enjoyed the book well enough, just not as much as I might have. For me it was the ideas that were the best part.

The core of it resolves around the idea of choice, and the tendency we have for taking the good things in our lives for granted.<br/><br/>We face choices every day. Some small. Some large.

I spent a few years reading dark fantasy, before burning out on it. This isn't really in the same category, but it's definitely not what I'd consider a fun book.<br/><br/>This seems to be a tale of two halves. I seem to have a few friends who like me found the first half of this book incredibly difficult to read through, and not very enjoyable, but found the second half better. Then there are others who seemed to love the first half and not the second. It goes to show you how books often speak differently to people.<br/><br/>Laurence and Patricia were interesting characters, but hard to like at times. I was sympathetic to their horrible upbringing, but their actions often left me confused. They often seemed to make matters worse. Maybe it's because while I had my issues growing up, it was nothing like Ms. Anders subjects them too. I really feel bad for anyone who has a childhood remotely like theirs, and consider myself lucky that I didn't.<br/><br/>Normally a book I read this fast would be an easy 5 star rating for me, but I found myself so conflicted for much of the story. I very much liked the idea of mixing magic and engineering. That's right in my wheelhouse. I would categorize this book as pure fantasy in a modern (or near future) setting though. The engineer may be based on sound principles (I can't speak to that myself), but you won't get much explanation about what Laurence and his friends are doing. I think that's for the best though. There is enough going on here without mixing hard sci-fi in too.<br/><br/>I liked this book. I didn't love it. I really don't enjoy depressing stories, and I found this far more depressing than something like [b:The Magicians|6101718|The Magicians (The Magicians, #1)|Lev Grossman|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1313772941s/6101718.jpg|6278977], which is pretty up there too. I think if the first part of the story had been a lot less cringe inducing for me it would have been a solid 4 for me.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the ending, though it felt a bit rushed. I would have liked more time spent on the ""big reveal"" rather than just the final few chapters. I saw part of it coming, but I think the ending might have been stronger if it was revealed a bit earlier on.<br/><br/>Overall I think this is one of those books where people may enjoy one half more than the other.

The underlying mystery of Severin and the world building were intriguing. I particularly enjoyed the chapters with Erasmo and Cynthia and Mary Pellam's diary entries. Unfortunately that was it. If the whole book had been written like those chapters, I'd have been a lot happier.<br/><br/>I found the chapters for Percival's final movie extremely confusing and often nonsensical. Most of the other chapters were unmemorable or equally confusing. It just feels like I was always missing something. I'd reread passages and whole pages and came away just as confused.<br/><br/>The book seemed to have 2 endings. Much like the book, I found the first one confusing and frustrating. However I was surprised to find I liked the second. It kind of sums things up nicely for me. Confused and frustrated most of the time, with some parts I was surprised to like. Maybe you'll have a better experience with it than I did.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

If not for <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword & Laser</a> I probably never would have read this.<br/><br/>This is one of those books that read at a different point, I might have been bored by. I’ve been a bit burnt out on reading lately and this seemed to hit the spot. This is the classic chosen one trope mixed with the magic school trope. I’m a complete sucker for the Magic school trope. <br/><br/>It was obvious at times that this was Ms. Lackey’s first book. The writing was decent, but could use some more polish.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise for me were all the social issues casually woven into the story, especially given the time this was published. It seems like only recently that books are dealing with things like gender equality, homosexuality or casual sex without negative connotations are more commonplace. This book covers all of those things, but in subtle ways. It could simply be that my own personal reading selection in the 80s and 90s simply neglected other works covering these kinds of things. <br/><br/>This certainly seems to be a book aimed at young women more than boys. Much of my reading was stuff my mom brought home for me. I doubt the cover with the girl on the magic horse was something I’d have been willing to give a try in my teens. That said, who wouldn’t want a magic horse as your companion? If you don’t, you might be dead inside!<br/><br/>If this book was published today, it’d be put in the YA section and might be lost in vast array of fantasy aimed at young girls. In many ways this book feels like it could be a prototype for those books. However, as I don’t read a lot of YA anymore I could be wrong there.<br/><br/>The book ends in a pretty good place. The major issues seem to be wrapped up (albeit a bit too quickly and neatly). I feel like I might be up for reading more, but could be perfectly content to stop here.<br/><br/>Overall, I’m glad I read this book. I’m not sure if I’m going to continue on with the series. I’ll probably have to be in the right mood for it. Maybe this time next year.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I never got around to trying either of her previous two series, but after enjoying this one so much, they have definitely moved up in my queue.<br/><br/>All of my friends were raving about this book earlier this year, but if not for a daily deal, I might have overlooked it. I'm glad I didn't.<br/><br/>It will be hard to put into words exactly why I loved this book so much without massive spoilers to the plot. Suffice to say, this book was excellently written.<br/><br/>The book starts off rather dark and that gave me pause, yet somehow Ms. Jemisin sucked me into the narrative so completely that I was never really bothered by it. It's not all bleakness either. Much like life there are ups and downs, albeit maybe more downs than many people experience in a lifetime.<br/><br/>The stories of Damaya, Syenite, and Essun were all engaging, and intermixed in a perfect way that while you hated to step away from one story, you were always just as happy to return to another.<br/><br/>The world building is really fascinating to me too. I have a lot of questions lingering at the end, that I hope will be addressed in the later volumes. The magic is unique and interesting. That's getting harder and harder these days. Normally I like well explained and structured magic systems the best. In this case however the mystery of the magic system and sense of discovery as the book goes on worked really well for me.<br/><br/>This book is full of social commentary, that may turn some people away who just want a ""fun"" story. It's their loss. I think Ms. Jemisin does a great job of exploring issues relevant to our own world while telling an incredibly engaging and entertaining story. In fact some of the things were so well done, that I didn't notice them at first, or didn't really give the much thought until after stopping for the day.<br/><br/>This review doesn't do this excellent book justice. I rarely give books five stars though, so that should hopefully give some idea.<br/><br/>This is a refreshing book in an oversaturated fantasy market. I hope the next two can live up to bar set by this one. In the meantime I might have to make some time to check out some of Ms. Jemisin's previous work, especially since I own the first book of each of her last two series.",,,1,,,1,2015/09/15,Audible,Like new,,

The larger galactic issues presented in Justice seemed to take a backseat to smaller issues of a single space station.<br/><br/>This book was a bit of both, though more the latter than the former. I wondered how a book so short could wrap things up. The answer is, it can't. Not really. There are a ton of big issues largely ignored by this book, much like they were for the previous book.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean I was unhappy with the conclusion though. It's all about expectations. I think Ancillary Sword helped to prepare me for a much smaller resolution than I originally hoped for. This books wraps up most of the issues of that book nicely, to the detriment of the larger issues presented in Ancillary Justice.<br/><br/>If you're someone hoping for resolution of the galactic conflicts, you'll probably disappointed by this book. If like me however, you've come to love Breq as a protagonist, there is a lot to enjoy here. I think while not concluding her story by any means, it comes to a nice stopping place.<br/><br/>Ms. Leckie hits on the idea of there being no such thing as a true ending in her final chapter, which while true, I personally felt like a bit of excuse making to the people hoping for resolution to the larger conflicts that never come.<br/><br/>Still, after winning both the Hugo and the Nebula, there is a lot of expectations to live up to. You can't please everyone. For me personally I enjoy Breq enough and the way Ms. Leckie does other AI characters so much to not care so much. It was a fun book. I never expected I'd be cheering for a Space Station, but somehow I was. And that's to say nothing of Translator Zeiat who absolutely steals every scene they are in. All of the best quotes of the book can be attributed to them.<br/><br/>I really hope that Ms. Leckie does more books with this universe. I hope it's not the last we see of Breq either. If it is however, I think that's OK. I'd like some kind of conclusion to the larger issues of Ancillary Justice, but I'm content with where Breq's personal story leaves off here.",,,1,,,1,2015/10/06,Amazon,unspecified,,

If her Temeraire books are anywhere near this good, I need to make time to read them soon.<br/><br/>This book started a bit slow. Then the story felt like it really got going, and the next thing I knew, I'd read 100 pages. Things slowed down some in places, but I tore through several parts of it in 100 page chunks.<br/><br/>I've heard this compared to a fairy tail. I guess that's true. I haven't really read any since I was a kid, so my thoughts never really went there. For me, it reminds me a bit of Tolkien. The description of the woods, and the largely unexplained magic and my sense of wonder at the world. <br/><br/>In fact, normally I'm firmly in the [a:Brandon Sanderson|38550|Brandon Sanderson|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1394044556p2/38550.jpg] camp on magic. I like well defined magical systems where the characters stay within the rules that the author establishes early on in the book. However the fast and loose approach to magic here didn't bother me for some reason. I can see how it might bother some though. I liked the contrast and complementary nature of Agnieszka's magic compared to the Dragon's.<br/><br/>In fact the reaction of the Dragon to her magic, is probably why it didn't bother me. He was having my typical reaction for me. Of course his magic methods weren't very well explained either, but seemed to be methodical in nature.<br/><br/>The characters took time to grow on me, but I liked Agnieszka fairly early on, and mostly liked the Dragon by the end. I enjoy the trope of the cranky old wizard, and the Dragon largely fits that exactly, with a little derivation. For anyone tired of that trope, this may be a larger issue.<br/><br/>I thought Kasia served as a nice contrast to Agnieszka, and that contrast is used nicely by the author to add depth to both of them. The pair of them make for a nice change of pace for the typical fantasy protagonists.<br/><br/>The real lure for me was the forest. I've always enjoyed camping and hiking in the woods. It's something I don't do much these days, so living vicariously through characters in a book is the next best thing.<br/><br/>These aren't woods I'd want to visit though. I was fascinated by the mystery and discovery of the woods as the story progressed. There is also some pretty interesting world building with an ancient culture that has been largely lost to time. <br/><br/>Some of the details felt a bit rushed at the end, but I'll happily take that over this being book one in a series. This story is very well self-contained. There is plenty of room to tell future stories, but this can easily be picked up and consumed by itself, which seems rare for fantasy.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this, and I plan to move Ms. Novik's other work higher up on my To read list.",,,1,,,1,2015/08/01,Amazon,unspecified,,

The Janes don't earn the kind of merit badges I did as a scout, but then I never went to a camp quite so fantastical either.<br/><br/>I've been becoming a bit of a selective comic trade reader of late, and I'm happy to add another series to the list of things to read.<br/><br/>3.5 Stars rounded up for ending stronger than it started.<br/><br/><b><u>Artwork</u></b><br/>I didn't love the artwork at first, but it grew on me. I'm not sure if a different artist did the cover, or if it's simply a matter of time spent. I didn't think the characters were as well defined in actual panels.<br/><br/>But as I said it grew on me as it went on.

It's not all laughs however, and Ms. Day opens up a lot of personal details about her life that I would have never guessed. If you're a fan of Ms. Day's work, or just interested in the internet and the evolution of online video entertainment, I highly recommend this book. 4.5 Stars.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>Felicia Day changed my life. I never realized that until I started reading this book. That's impressive for someone I've never met before, but I suspect I'm not the only one whose life has been changed for the better thanks to Ms. Day.<br/><br/>I discovered the Guild closer to the end than the beginning of its run. As a longtime World of Warcraft junkie I found the show spoke to me personally. I knew people like all the characters, and saw parts of myself in some of them as well.<br/><br/>When I heard about Geek & Sundry, I was eager to see what Felicia Day had in store for us next. It was through Geek & Sundry that I discovered <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword & Laser</a> and Goodreads itself. Goodreads and many of its members have now become a large part of my daily life, and it's the one social network I use with any regularity.<br/><br/>I also rekindled my love of tabletop gaming. Thanks to Wil Wheaton, I found myself amassing a large stockpile of games that I never played. So I started a monthly game night that's now nearing it's 3rd year. So while I doubt Ms. Day will ever read this review, I wish to express my thanks at her for the many friends I've made and all the fun I've had as a result.<br/><br/>My initial thought when I heard about this book was to wonder just how much of a book there was for someone so young. Ms. Day and I are only a few years apart in age, but it's apparent she's accomplished a lot more of note than I have in that time. That's OK though, since I don't think I have anywhere close to the drive she has to make my mark on the world.<br/><br/>What was more surprising to me was how much we have in common. I had a similar experience finding an online community of people who shared my passions in the early days of the internet. Additionally the height of my WoW addiction apparently coincided with hers (and likely many many others). Apart from that however, we've led very different lives. <br/><br/>That said, I still feel like if I could get over my awkwardness and not just be a giant fanboy around her, we could be friends. I think that quality is what endears her so much to her fans. Her authenticity and genuine passion for the things she does comes through as she describes her journey.<br/><br/>I was sad to read about some of the struggles she's had at a time where her work was vastly improving my own life. I'm happy to see things seem to have improved for her. I hope she continues to forge her own path, and is able to focus on all the great things she's given the world and just ignore all the idiots and haters out there.<br/><br/>I for one look forward to seeing what Ms. Day has in store for all of us next. Even if she never matches her past successes, I hope she can take pride in all the lives she's improved, like my own.",,,1,,,1,2015/10/22,Amazon,Brand new,,

Maia kept meeting a bunch of people whose names I still can't keep straight.<br/><br/>Then somewhere around the midway point, the plot finally seemed to kick in and I was hooked.

I just wish the first half of it hadn't been so slow. I think that may turn a lot of people off who might end up liking it in the end as I did. There are just too many books out there to stick it out.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this deserves the Nebula it's been nominated for, but I can see why it was nominated. But I expect a lot of people will question it however. The sense of danger prevalent in most fantasy novels is never really there. The conflicts may be a bit too light/easy for some. For me though, it was just what I needed.<br/><br/>And I'm glad that it's a stand alone. That is so rare these days.

I'd like to give this a 3.5 star rating, but I just can't round that up to a 4 star.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>This book was getting a lot of hype from my circle of friends. Several of them seem to read nothing but ARCs these days so I always seem to get reviews and recommendations of books that are coming out. That coupled with the very reasonable ebook cost made picking this up a no brainer.<br/><br/>This book took a very long time to click with me. I really liked the last 25% or so, but the first 75% was good but not great. I had no problem picking it up every night, but it was never really a book I hated to put down or was rushing to pick up.<br/><br/>The world building is pretty different from most of the stuff I've read, and that's hard to do these days. I like the concept of mirror worlds a lot. That's probably the thing that will keep me reading this series. It's really a sort of epic fantasy novel with a sci-fi twist.<br/><br/>My main issue with this book was the characters. I just never connected with any of them. It's one thing to make ""grey"" characters who are neither good or bad, but they have to be likable. I need to understand why they live in that gray area, and it can't be because they are selfish and do whatever they want to without any thought to the consequences or how it will impacts others.<br/><br/>I was pretty excited at the idea of a matriarchal society to change things up. This may be an unpopular opinion, but it just came off feeling gimmicky to me. Maybe the idea was that you can put female characters into the same roles as male ones and nothing would change, but if so that doesn't work for me. I want it to be different. <br/><br/>Her characters didn't feel like women to me. That isn't to say they needed to be defer to a guy, or staying behind while men do all the fighting. Several other writers have created vicious women, strong women, smart women that break the tropes for women in fantasy while still feeling like women to me.<br/><br/>Most of Ms. Hurely's characters felt like male characters shoved in women's bodies. She plays with gender in this book a bit too. People can sort of choose what gender they want to be, and one of the character's genders is constantly changing. None of that bothers me, but I am sort of confused about it's relevance to the story. Maybe there isn't one, or maybe we'll find out later. I'll be curious to see which.<br/><br/>The book is very well written. It's very dark though. I wasn't expecting that. There are a few pretty cringe worthy parts. Overall this book had a lot of potential that just fell a bit short on the execution for me. <br/><br/>I'll likely be continuing on with this series, but I probably won't be rushing out to get the next one when it comes out.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The name was familiar to me, but I wouldn't have been able to have named you any books or series by her.<br/><br/>I couldn't tell you if this is her usual style of book, but if it is, I'll definitely be interested in reading more. This doesn't seem to be as popular as some of her other series though. I found this a quick and enjoyable listen.<br/><br/>It's a play on the chosen one trope, but there is more of a focus on politics. Our protagonist has been playing stupid for years in an effort to reduce the chances his father finds him a threat and killing him.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for him, this means that his father also doesn't trust him to take over after he's gone and names his uncle to rule in his place, at least until his 21st birthday. So of course our hero sets out to make a name for himself and show his uncle that he's not really the fool he's been pretending all these years.<br/><br/>And of course he gets swept up into events bigger than himself and must rise to the occasion or see his friends, family and home suffer.<br/><br/>In a worlds where dragons are long extinct and magic is dwindling, this is more political than fantastical overall, but there is certainly enough in there to make it more than a historical fantasy.<br/><br/>This is book one of a duology, but I feel like it came to a pretty good stopping point where I don't feel I need to rush out right away to read the second book, or (given it's shorter length) like it was simply one book that was split in half.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this a fun and lighter book and I'm looking forward to listening to the conclusion soon.",,,1,,,1,2014/06/15,Review Copy,Like new,,

For some reason this story wasn't as much fun. It's hard to put my finger on exactly why. <br/><br/>My best guess is the pacing. For such a short book, it felt like the plot meandered too much on unimportant details. The beginning was strong. It pulled me right back in again, and I thought everything was good to go. But then it got slow in middle, and felt sort of rushed at the end. I was sort of underwhelmed by the final confrontation especially.<br/><br/>I guess since I wasn't having as much fun with the story this go around and it made the quality of the writing more noticeable. I'm not one to spend much time commenting on the writing too much. I tend to leave that for English teachers/literary types.<br/><br/>I care a lot more about story and character development than I do about how elegant the prose are. If you're entertaining me, I'm not going to notice bad sentence structure/dialogue.<br/><br/>If I had to sum this book up with one sentence it would be ""Hurog means Dragon."" Why you ask? Well because it's said at least once per chapter. Often more than once. Or at least that's how it felt. Eventually I groaned every time another character said it. <br/><br/>I wonder if the writing was just as bad in the first book and I didn't notice. ""Hurog means dragon"" was said a few times in that book as well, but it didn't seem nearly so frequent. I didn't really find the dialogue or prose that bad.<br/><br/>Glancing over other reviews it seems like I may be in the minority.

Will Ms. Leckie continue on her success or fall into the dreaded ""sophomore slump""?

If I'm perfectly honest, I don't notice or care most of the time. I'm not sure if that's the point. To me it just feels like a gimmick though. But it really doesn't matter to me one way or the other.

I was happy to see that Ms. Leckie managed to continue that on in this book as well. I think it's a really cool idea that makes for very unique storytelling.<br/><br/>Overall though, this book felt smaller. We spend most of it on a single planet and an orbiting station.

Whether it's one of those ""well they are just a product of their times"" type of books, or just something so different from what modern SFF writers do, I just don't like most of it.<br/><br/>So I was a little bit concerned coming into this book. I needn't have been. Yes it's different than what I normally read. It's much shorter. There isn't a ton of depth or world building here. But it's a fun story that sets up some interesting ideas that I hope to find time to continue exploring.<br/><br/>The prose are something I don't usually spend much time, but I'd be remiss not to mention it. They are absolutely beautiful. Some people have said it distracts from the story, but that wasn't the case for me.<br/><br/>This books reminds me a lot of [b:The Name of the Wind|186074|The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)|Patrick Rothfuss|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1270352123s/186074.jpg|2502879].

I wish I had first read this as a teenager rather than as an adult. I think I would appreciate it more. However, as a fantasy fan I can certainly appreciate and enjoy what is here.<br/><br/>The story moves along at a pretty good pace for most of the book, but does slow down a bit in the last third or so.<br/><br/>My only other complaint is less a complaint more than a puzzlement. Ms. Le Guin decided to break from the norm and have most of her characters be people of color. Yet she has almost no women, and the ones that are there are thin stereotypes.

It got added to the pile, but didn't really sound like the type of book I'd normally read, so I didn't rush out to do so.<br/><br/>I'm glad it was chosen as the December pick for <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword & Laser</a> because I was missing out. I really liked it.<br/><br/>However, I don't think this is a book that everyone will love. The plot is slow moving. Many of the characters are a bit thin. However the world building is excellent. The sights, sounds and smells of this book just seep from the pages. I don't have the best imagination when reading, but it was impossible not to be swept up in the imagery here.<br/><br/>This is one of those books more about the journey than the destination. I knew I'd like this book regardless of how it ended. I loved the circus as a kid, but I've never experienced one as magical as this one. I wish such a thing existed.<br/><br/>I liked Bailey's story more than the main one for some reason. The whole competition made for some excellent things that made me want to visit the circus even more, but did little to endear either of the competitors to me very much. I also really liked the Rêveurs. I thought it was a great ode to fandom of all kinds in a way that felt natural and obvious in the scope of the book.<br/><br/>I'm not really a fan of ""hand wavy"" magic systems that aren't well developed or explained. However in this case, it's a good fit. It's a book where you want to just be swept up in the atmosphere and not worry too much about the details.<br/><br/>I have a few minor complaints that prevent me from giving this a 5 star rating, but they really aren't worth getting into.

I would have been missing out.<br/><br/>This one was slow to grab me. The protagonist does not have one point of view but many. How you ask? Well it's a sentient ship made up of hundreds of mobile units referred to as Ancillaries. Just what is an ancillary exactly? It's not exactly clear at the start so, you'll have to read to find out.<br/><br/>I'm not very well read in Sci-Fi, so I don't know if this concept of Ancillaries is new or derivative of previous works, but it felt very unique to me. It was hard to get accustomed to at first. <br/><br/>The sudden swap of perspectives on the same scene can be quite jarring and confusing. As I'm only a solitary unit, and not a shared collective I don't think well that way.<br/><br/>I don't recall if this is the first time I've read a book with an artificial intelligence as the protagonist, but the fact that I can't certainly shows it's something unusual for me. I think Ms. Lackie does a good job with it. It certainly doesn't feel human to me, but that doesn't make it uninteresting.<br/><br/>I don't tend to spend a lot of time thinking about the books I'm reading while I'm reading them. I've seen/read far to many Movies/TV/Books over the years that when I do, it can ruin the experience for me. I tend to just ""sit back and enjoy the ride"" as it were and saving the thinking for when I'm done. This one was hard to do that though. There was a lot going on, I couldn't help but wonder and theorize.<br/><br/>My only real complaint about this one is it takes too long for you to know what exactly is going on. The story alternates chapters between past and present until meeting somewhere in the middle and you finally have things click into place. I can see this turning people away from the book and missing out.<br/><br/>There are just too many books out there competing for everyone's attention and it's too easy to put down something that doesn't grab you right away. Overall though, I really enjoyed this one and will be waiting for the next book in the series to come out.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

If anything distinguishes the two it's that this one doesn't focus on a male whose righting wrongs with his sword, but a woman who is doing it with her wits (and some help from the gods).<br/><br/>I think this is one of those books you need to be in the right mood for. It's not a fast-paced, action packed sword and sorcery story. It's also not a politically charged struggle for power. Often times it seems that when strong woman are portrayed in fantasy, they are politically savvy nobility maneuvering for power.<br/><br/>Instead we have a woman who decides she needs a journey. Not for adventure. Not for glory. Simply because she needs a break. Royina Ista has spent most of her life under a family curse or control of someone else. She just needs to get away. This doesn't seem to make sense to anyone else, so she does so under the guise of making a religious pilgrimage to pray for her daughter to have a grandson.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for her (and fortunately the reader), the gods have other plans. Royina Ista is confronted with raiding soldiers, demons, sorcerers and a plot that threatens the safety of all of Chalion. There is a bit a of romance thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>All and all this is a well written and enjoyable fantasy story that is quite different from just about everything I read.",,,1,,,1,2014/03/15,Audible,Like new,,

There does end up being magic however. And Gods of great power.<br/><br/>Mostly however, this is a political story with a medieval setting. The characters are well written and interesting. Large parts of the plot are rather predictable, but that's not always a bad thing. It's the characters that make this book enjoyable.<br/><br/>It's also nice to get away from all the grimdark fantasy I've been reading with something lighter. There are certainly some awful things that happen/described in this book, but nothing to the level of Song of Ice and Fire, Malazen, etc.<br/><br/>Despite being listed as Chalion, #1 by good reads, this is a stand alone story. My understanding is it is actually 3 stand alone stories set in the same world. <br/><br/>That is both a nice change from most fantasy these days, and a little sad, because I've grown attached to her characters and would like to see how they make out after the story ends.<br/><br/>This is my first book by Ms. McMaster Bujold, but won't be my last.

So if it's not your thing either, I wouldn't let the fact that protagonist is a Jesuit turn you away.<br/><br/>I can't really speak to how religious people view this book, but I don't think it's an anti-religion book either.

It seemed to jump all over the place, and when it finally came time to battle the ""threads"" that threatened Pern, it jumped off again (time travel: go!), then ended rather abruptly.

If it hadn't been a club pick and so short, I might have considered dropping it all together.<br/><br/>Maybe this is a book I would have enjoyed as a kid, but it's hard for me to say.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It's still early in the month but so far most of the discussion seems to be in the <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1233165-is-anyone-else-having-a-hard-time-getting-started"">Is anyone else having a hard time getting started?</a> thread. I must say I don't really understand this.<br/><br/>Sure this book is dense at times. The book also starts with a lot of world building. It gives you several character perspectives as well. But it's well written, and the plot is compelling.<br/><br/>It centers around a neutral space station over the planet Pell caught in the middle of a war between ""The Company"" and ""The Union"".<br/><br/>This book reminds me a lot of Star Trek: Deep Space 9 or Babylon 5. To a lesser degree Battlestar Galactica. Mostly because the latter had a lot more space battles. <br/><br/>Cherryh doesn't spend pages detailing epic battles here. Sometimes you see the aftermath, or get the report of a distant battle when news reaches Pell station. There aren't completely missing however. I like a good space battle as much as the next sci-fi geek, but it's not a requirement for me.<br/><br/>What this books does have is political-driven agendas, greed, ambition, and a surprising amount of compassion (at least from some of the characters). <br/><br/>Like some popular fantasy series I've read (Song of Ice & Fire/Malazan Fallen) Cherryh gives you multiple points of view on the situation. Unlike those books however, there aren't as many shades of grey. Or weren't for me. I knew pretty early on mostly whose good and whose bad, and I'm not suddenly surprised at the end. <br/><br/>There are some exceptions however that seem to reside in a shade of grey, but not many.<br/><br/>Overall a very enjoyable book. I'm a little disappointed to find out there is no true sequel to this book as there are a lot things I'm interested in reading more about in the aftermath. <br/><br/>The conclusion is satisfying however, and I hope to check out more books in this universe at some point down the road, but I won't be rushing out to get the next book just yet.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I enjoyed the ending though.<br/><br/><b>Audiobook:</b> Simon Prebble is fantastic. He's the kind of narrator that adds something extra to the book. He made the slow parts of this book (of which there were many) a lot more bearable. He does a variety of voices and accents. He has great inflection with his normal reading voice too. He transitions between the story and footnotes seamlessly (probably better than I would had I been reading the text too). If you're going to do this book, audio is a great option. It's long though at 32 hours plus. You really get your money's worth with this one.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>This one has been on my radar for a few years. A friend of mine whose opinion on books I typically share really enjoyed it, especially in audio. I kept meaning to borrow it from him, but never got around to it. Then they released the mini-series last year, and I wanted to do the book first, but still never got to it. Audible had it on sale earlier t his month and I finally decided to pick it up and listen.<br/><br/>I was slow to get into it. Mr. Norrell is completely unlikable. I think that was intentional, but it didn't make the first 10 hour or so which were largely about him any better to listen to. Jonathan Strange and his wife were probably the only two characters I liked. Stephen, the butler wasn't bad too, but I generally despised (or was indifferent to) the rest. That always makes a read harder for me.<br/><br/>I like parts of the book, but every time I was getting into the story I'd hit another lull. I was never completely bored, but I found my attention wandering far more often than is normal for me.<br/><br/>I like some historical fiction, and this book reads a lot like that. In fact the magic was largely absent through much of the early goings. I think the highlight for me were the footnotes. They were often the best part of the story. We'd get a side story that was far more interesting than the main plot.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed parts of this book far more than others. I think if it had been shorter, or certain subplots had been removed entirely I would have given it another star. I can see why my friend liked it so much, but sadly I didn't share his opinion this time around. I still plan to check out the mini-series, but I'm not in a big hurry to do so.",,,1,,Tom Schreck,1,2016/06/05,Audible,Like new,,

Based on good reads, I've given 5 stars to roughly 13% of the 221 books I've rated as of this writing. 18% of those have been given out this year. It's not exactly relevant to this review, but I'm an engineer and that sort of thing interests me.<br/><br/>I forget where exactly I first heard about this book, but <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword and Laser</a> did an <a href=""http://swordandlaser.com/home/2012/10/15/sl-podcast-112-interview-with-g-willow-wilson.html"">interview</a> with Ms. Wilson last year, and that moved this book up in my list. The paperback was released last month, so I've finally gotten around to reading it.<br/><br/>I was expecting this book to be more cyberpunk than fantasy considering the main character is a hacker. After reading it, I wouldn't classify it as cyberpunk or even sci-fi. It is however a great book.<br/><br/>People who know me well would probably tell you I'm not very political or religious. That doesn't mean I'm not interested in those things, but both can be very sensitive issues, and I tend not to discuss them. This book contains some of both, but I didn't feel like I was being preached to in any way.<br/><br/>This book was being written prior the Arab Spring that occurred in Egypt. Ms. Wilson apparently saw this coming, and when no one seemed to want to listen to her talk about it, she was inspired to write a fictional story about it instead (based on an interview included in my book). She admits to having doubts that it might ever occur, but she hoped it could based on changes she was observing first hand.<br/><br/>Alif is a young Muslim half Arab, half Indian(and therefore considered an outcast by the full Arabs apparently) hacker who lives in an nonspecific Middle East country. He is not particularly religious or political. He sells his computer skills to anyone who wants them: Communists, Fundamentalists, Dissidents, Smut Peddlers, etc. Anyone who needs to avoid being caught and arrested by a strict government censorship.<br/><br/>Alif's world is suddenly turned upside down (thanks to a girl, go figure), discovers that the Jinn he's read about in books are real, and gets caught up in wild adventure where not only his life is at stake, but the lives of his friends, family and the country as a whole. <br/><br/>Fans of [a:Patrick Rothfuss|108424|Patrick Rothfuss|http://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1351307341p2/108424.jpg] may enjoy the stories within the story. I'm not sure if they are original stories by Ms. Wilson herself, Middle Eastern folk tales, or some combination of both.<br/><br/>I hadn't really planned to read this in one weekend, and I very nearly read it all in one day.

I had seen the movie before reading the book, so I had a pretty good feel for what was going to happen.<br/><br/>In fact, it seemed like the movie was pretty true to the book with very few changes that I can remember.<br/><br/>The largest differences were increasing the size of the roles of some of the supporting and minor characters over the book since the book offers everything pretty much from Katriss's perspective. She does have some rather ""impressive"" insights into the thinking of some of the others that I think are better portrayed by showing the other characters doing those things instead.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly though, the book was better than the movie, but both were just so-so to me. The book offers much better insight to the thought process and motivation of some of the characters that I just didn't find apparent in the movie.<br/><br/>You especially get to know a lot more about Rue, who was relegated to few little screen time in the movie with no real sense of why she and Kat had affection for one another.<br/><br/>My biggest issue is that for a book dealing with a battle to the death, the violence level is fairly low.

I've seen all the movies, but very few episodes. I've watched all of the other series though. It's quite possible I missed a bunch of jokes as a result. There were definitely a few Next Generation jokes in there I got, especially one about everyone's favorite Ensign.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed most of the Malazan Fallen series, and I'm a big Star Trek fan, so I had pretty high hopes for this. Despite being ""Grimdark"" there are some really funny parts in Malazan, especially among the Marines. I think that sort of humor is harder to write, but maybe not. Humor is always hard in general. What one person finds hilarious the next person might find dumb.<br/><br/>With any humor or satire book, you are largely made and broken by the quality of the laughs. This book had some pretty hilarious parts, but often I was fairly uninterested in the characters and the plot.<br/><br/>The actual writing itself is fine, but story is so ridiculous at times that I just didn't care. The main character is intentionally an asshole. I kind of got tired of that by the end. For what the book is, it was fine, and I don't regret reading it. It was a quick listen.<br/><br/>Overall, I was a bit underwhelmed by this one, but I can easily see big fans of the Original Star Trek series enjoying this a lot more than I did.

The daring and (maybe a bit crazy or stupid) use specialized equipment to dive deep under the sand and recover anything deemed valuable to be traded for money and supplies and just to get by.<br/><br/>The story is once again split up into multiple parts. The early books seems to each focus on a single POV, while the later ones jump around between them. All of our POV characters are from the same family. The children ranging in age from 10 to late 20's I believe.<br/><br/>The oldest, Vic (short for Victoria not Victor) is probably my favorite though all of her younger brothers are interesting in their own right.<br/><br/>It's a dangerous world full of thieves, murders and revolutionaries. Like his Silo books, the central story is a bit of a mystery. What happened? Why is the world buried under Sand? And on a smaller scale, what happened to the father of kids who walked off into the desert one night 10 years ago and never returned?<br/><br/>This was a short and enjoyable read. As it's post apocalyptic it's more on the dark side so I'm reluctant to call it ""light"", but it can certainly be called an easy read. There isn't a ton of depth here, but it moves along at a quick pace. I'd say if you enjoyed his previous books you'll likely enjoy this one as well.<br/><br/>3.5 Stars.",,,1,,,1,2014/08/20,Review Copy,Like new,,

I used to watch the history channel for hours. I'm not sure why I never really got into historical fiction, or even nonfiction for that matter.<br/><br/>I don't remember much about Rome however. I looked up Cicero and Tiro after the fact, and they were both real people, who did some of the things described in this book. Along with many of the supporting characters. Of course their personalities and dialogue is all fiction or at least embellished/inferences on the author's part.<br/><br/>It's probably better I don't know the real history. It would probably just annoy me in some places where he takes too much artistic license.<br/><br/>The way this book started, I thought I was really going to love this book. But it slowed down somewhere around the 50% mark and didn't pick back up until the end. The writing was good, and for the most part the pacing was good. He also did a good job bringing long dead people to life. I just found things way too detailed at times. He kept talking about details of Roman politics I just don't care about.<br/><br/>The best parts of this book were when Cicero was outmaneuvering his rivals either with clever planning, or clever speeches. I like a good political story from time to time, and Roman politics seem to have been pretty brutal.<br/><br/>I will probably continue on with this series, but most likely wait until he finally puts the third book out, as this one ends in a stopping good place and I have no idea if the second one does the same.",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

Most of what I do read tends to be about computer stuff. However video games have been an important part of my life for as long as I can remember.<br/><br/>I still consider the 16-bit generation to be one of the best. The games hold up so much better than the 32/64 bit generation that followed as 3d was being introduced. The art style is a lot more timeless and some really great games were released. It probably helps that I was 10-13 or so during this time period.<br/><br/>I was a Nintendo kid. I own every console from NES through Game Cube, plus the original Game Boy. Nintendo lost me in college as they continue to focus on kids and decided to neglect those of us who belong to the ""Nintendo Generation"".<br/><br/>This is the first book I've read on this time period. From the title, I was expecting this to talk about both sides of the ""Console Wars"" and that was my first disappointment. If I had read the blurb, I would have realized that this was mostly Sega's story. In particular, Tom Kalinske's story. He was brought in to run Sega of America and take on Nintendo.<br/><br/>It's hard to know if I was just too young for Sega at the time, or if I truly just like Nintendo better, but I never got the big deal. Give me Mario over Sonic anyday. Or really screw them both and give me a new Zelda game to play.<br/><br/>That said if not for Sega and Tom Kalinske, the video game industry would be that much poorer for it as Nintendo had a near monopoly before he showed up and turned things on their head.<br/><br/>Mr. Harris did extensive interviews to write this book, and I imagine he either got more time/better interviews from the Sega folks than the Nintendo side. You get glimpses of the inner workings of Nintendo, but most of the time you see the actions of Nintendo through the eyes of their competitors. If you were a Nintendo kid like I was, you may find yourself as disappointed with this as I was. If you're a Sega fan, you might come away differently.<br/><br/>The other big drawback of this book is the format. For some reason he decided to write the book as though he/we were present while events were happening and apparently made up a bunch of the dialogue and conversations in the book based on his interviews.<br/><br/>What this does in my opinion is bloat the book while rarely going deep on some of the key points. He could have either written a much shorter version of the same book, or given a lot more depth at the same length.<br/><br/>It does make the book very readable though. It's an easy read, and there is definitely a lot of interesting stuff in here that those of us who grew up during this time period or are simply fans of video games and their history should enjoy.<br/><br/>He touches on most of the major events: The introduction of Sonic the Hedgehog, The launch of the SNES, The Sega Scream and ad blitz, Mortal Kombat, the government hearings on violence in video games and the creation of the ESRB. Things end with the first E3, the launch of the Sega Saturn, and Sony's entry into the market with the Playstation.<br/><br/>I think if this book got more in depth and was more balanced with its inside looks at both Sega and Nintendo it would have been a much better book, but it's still a good one worth a look if you're a fan.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Parts of the ending I didn't see coming, but probably should have. I thought he wrapped up Mara's story particularly well. I was a bit disappointed this book didn't have the same scale of space battles as the last two though. It did have the requisite lightsabre duel that was two books in the making.<br/><br/>This book seemed to focus a lot more on Talon Karrde, who is probably my favorite new character of the series. A lot of the parts I found slow in the last book are paying dividends here and important to the resolution of some of the threads.<br/><br/>In general, I have a lot of the same feelings about this book as I did with the last two. Admiral Thrawn still feels a little too smart to be believable at times, though not nearly as bad as the last book. The writing could be a little better. However, this is a series to read more for the fun of being back in the Star Wars universe and not something that is read for the high quality prose.<br/><br/>Overall this was a pretty fun series that makes me want to check out some other star wars books in the future.

So could the middle book of this trilogy top the original as well? No it couldn't.<br/><br/>I found the middle of the book particularly slow, especially Leia's storyline. However the ending of this book make up for the slow pace by being pretty non-stop action.<br/><br/>Apart from finding parts of the book slow, my only major complaint is the level of intuition of Grand Admiral Thrawn. There were a few parts where I was able to predict what was going to happen, not because it seemed like it was reasonable, but simply because Thrawn has rather ridiculous levels of deduction. I mean, I wonder if even Sherlock Holmes would be able to draw the same conclusions. It had me rolling my eyes and going ""Oh come on"" at points.<br/><br/>I guess though when Luke is able to see glimpses of the future using the force you have to do something to create a worthy adversary. However I just found Mr. Zahn went a little overboard in this book compared with the first.<br/><br/>That said, I still rather enjoyed the book. It's a lot of fun with characters I love.

Then earlier this year one of my favorite authors (well it's 2 guys, but whatever) wrote a book about Han Solo called [b:Honor Among Thieves|18050080|Honor Among Thieves (Star Wars  Empire and Rebellion, #2)|James S.A. Corey|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1385232527s/18050080.jpg|24581828]. My friend told me it's a pretty good book that could be read without reading other Star Wars books and he was right.<br/><br/>I did the audio with Marc Thompson and that finally pushed me over the edge on giving this one a try. I know that Disney decided all the EU are no longer canon (if they ever really were), but I think they'd be stupid to discount this book completely when writing episode 7. If nothing else, Mr. Zahn adds some great characters to already beloved cast of the series.<br/><br/>I found Admiral Thrawn a little <i>too</i> smart at places almost to feel unbelievable, but not often. He certainly makes for a great villian.<br/><br/>Mara Jade I had heard of before, was not what I expected given what little I did know of her. I'll be curious to see how her character develops in the next two books.<br/><br/>Talon Karrde reminds me a lot of Han Solo. Sure he's a criminal, but he's got a code he lives by. He's honorable to a point, and you don't mess with one of his own. It's interesting to see him fill the vaccum of Jaba the Hutt and he couldn't be more different from him.<br/><br/>In addition to the great new characters all the big names are here, Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, C3PO, and R2D2. Plus others like Admiral Ackbar and Lando Calrissian.<br/><br/>The story was pretty good and moved at a decent pace. My only real gripe with it is that sometimes there seemed to be a lot of ""coincidences"" like characters showing up at the same place at the same time, or some of Admiral Thrawn's insights.<br/><br/>Being the first book in a trilogy I didn't expect a lot of resolution, but I thought it stopped in a good place. Of course I don't have to wait and have already jumped right into [b:Dark Force Rising|216442|Dark Force Rising (Star Wars  The Thrawn Trilogy, #2)|Timothy Zahn|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1327870067s/216442.jpg|463790].<br/><br/>Overall I found it enjoyable and wish I had read it sooner.

So I borrowed it from the library instead and didn't feel obligated to read all the stories.<br/><br/>It's quite possible I would have enjoyed other stories, but there is always so much to read, and so little time, so I pretty much just focused on the authors I already really like. In particular I picked up this anotholgy to read Patrick Rothfuss and Scott Lynch.<br/><br/>The Rothfuss story about Bast definitely lived up to expectations, but I wonder how enjoyable it would be to anyone not already familiar to the series. If you're a fan of that series however, I definitely think it's worth borrowing this just to read that.<br/><br/>The Scott Lynch Story was initially disappointing simply because in an anthology entitled ""Rogues"" I couldn't imagine it being anything but a Gentleman Bastards story. However as I read it I came to love the characters and the world Mr. Lynch introduced in this story, and I hope he revisits it at some point in the future, just not until he's finished his Gentleman Bastard series. This was my favorite story in the book though, slightly edging out Mr. Rothfuss.<br/><br/>The rest of the stories I read were pretty good, but none really stand out as must reads for me. <br/><br/>I love [a:James S.A.

Daniel Abraham's story was enjoyable enough that I'll definitely try to get to some of his fantasy novels sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>The highlight of the Joe Abercrombie story was the brief cameo of Friendly from [b:Best Served Cold|2315892|Best Served Cold|Joe Abercrombie|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1347732723s/2315892.jpg|2322406]. I'm not sure if there are other cameos since I haven't read all of his novels yet, but I was annoyed at the pulp fiction-esque lack of payoff. Still, it was a fun story.<br/><br/>I read the story by Gillian Flynn based on several recommendations, and it was enjoyable.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment was the George R.R. Martin story. Like his story in Dangerous Women, it's not so much a story as a historical account, and it reads very dry.<br/><br/>I've actually read very little Neil Gaiman, but I had watched a BBC mini-series version of the Neverwhere from the 90s.

Bray before this, but I definitely will be more inclined to listen to anything else he reads from now on.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I'm always more of a sword than a laser. I tend to watch sci-fi and  stick to fantasy for reading. Most of the sci-fi books I do enjoy are more space fantasy or space opera types. I'm not really into hard sci-fi despite having a science and math background. It just feels too much like work I guess.<br/><br/>So I hadn't really planned on reading this book despite all the hype it's been getting lately. Thankfully <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword & Laser</a> decided to make this their May pick, because I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I've seen it described as MacGuyver in Space and that seems really fitting. Mark Watney is an engineer and a Botanist. He's good at problem solving and fixing things. That probably a good thing as he finds himself left behind on Mars with both limited supplies and food.<br/><br/>The story takes the form of log entries, leaving the reader to wonder if Mark made it through his ordeal or if we're simply listening to the record of his final days recovered at some later date.<br/><br/>The book is a bit formulaic:<br/><br/>1. Evaluate Problem for possible solutions.<br/>2. Fix Problem<br/>3. Make humorous remarks about the Problem.<br/>4. Discover what new Problem crops up as a result.<br/>5. Repeat.<br/><br/>This may sound boring to some folks, but it just worked for me. It really helped that just as I was starting to think this he started interspersing Mark's log entries with events of the people at NASA back on Earth as they are trying to do all they can to recover Mark alive.<br/><br/>I think that anyone who don't find the jokes as funny as I did (laughing uncontrollably a few times while cleaning dishes in the break room or riding my bike), may grow tired of the story.<br/><br/>The science seems pretty good to me. However that's not something I normally care much about. As long as it seems mostly reasonable I don't give it much thought. I'm sure there are things that are wrong or could be nitpicked by people who know better than me.<br/><br/>Also anyone looking for case study of isolation and desperation that results from being left behind on Mars will be disappointed. I can't say that I spent much time thinking ""Mark's mental state doesn't seem realistic to me."" People who say that may probably be right. <br/><br/>However, astronauts are chosen not only for their skill-set and physical fitness, but mental fitness as well. I tend to make jokes when I'm stressed. Mark makes a lot of jokes. To me that seems fitting for someone between being super busy just trying to stay alive. Your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>I for one really enjoyed this book and it's put me in a total sci-fi mood for both TV and in my choice of audiobooks. I'll be eagerly awaiting for Mr. Weir's next novel as this was an excellent debut.",,,1,,,1,2014/05/03,Audible,Brand new,,

I think if I could give it a 4.5 star rating I might. However, the end had me so wrapped up in it, and I enjoyed this book/series so much that I rounded up for a change, something I almost never do.<br/><br/>The reality is I don't have any complaints about this book. The worst I could say is that the pace slows down from fast to normal in a few points. I love the characters, I love the world, I love the magic. The writing continues to improve with each book, as does the character development and world building.<br/><br/>I found the ending very satisfactory, and it's the first book I've read this year I kept being eager to pick back up and hated to set down.

I was pretty indifferent towards Nila in the past books. I know many people I discussed it with didn't like her at all until this book. Her story here is a lot more interesting and I never minded all the POV shifting as I couldn't wait to read what happens next in each of the stories.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the first two books, I think you'll easily love this one, and should check this one out as soon as you can. <br/><br/>Now I'll have to read some of the short stories to hold me over until to the first book of his next Powder Mage trilogy comes out.

It's one of my all time favorite books. It's not the best written, or the even the best story. It just hits all the right buttons for me. In fact, I reread it not to long ago and loved it just as much.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to checking out what Mr. Cline had in store for us next. Could it be as good as his first book? Of course not, or at least I'd have been shocked if it were. However it seems like many people who loved that book were not only disappointed in this book, but downright upset.<br/><br/>That wasn't the case for me. There a ton of similarities to Ready Player One and several stories, most notably the Last Starfighter and Ender's Game. Mr. Cline acknowledges that right away and makes it part of the narrative.<br/><br/>Our protagonist Zach Lightman is a high school gamer who's obsessed with the games/music/movies of the past. Gee where have I read that before? This book isn't breaking any new ground. In fact it's treading on very familiar ground.<br/><br/>I thought it started a bit slow, but once I got into it I was having a blast. That should be obvious when you see I listened to the whole thing in just two days. It's only 12 hours, but I normally average 3 hours/day. I kept finding things to do so I could keep listening.<br/><br/>Ordinarily that kind of thing would mean a 5 star book for me, but while this book is fun, it's just not as good as others. It hits many of the same buttons as Ready Player One, just not as hard I guess. That doesn't make me mad or disappointed though.<br/><br/>I'll probably give it another listen down the road though. The door for a sequel seems to have been left open, so maybe I'll listen to it again at that point.<br/><br/>Not need to rush out and grab this one, but if you get it on sale, or need a light quick read, it's worth a look in my opinion.",,,1,,,1,2015/07/16,,unspecified,,

He does a variety of voices and speaks with great inflections making this series a big plus in audio.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>In many ways my review for this book could be a repeat of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/868915547"">my review</a> for [b:The Providence of Fire|22055280|The Providence of Fire (Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne, #2)|Brian Staveley|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1405301050s/22055280.jpg|39923827]. I found the emperor's kids to be annoying, and often incompetent. Just less so. I think Gwenna's chapters/story was far more interesting and enjoyable. In particular both Kayden and Adele had parts I found slowed the overall story, and left me eager to get back to other subplots.<br/><br/>Gwenna's story meanwhile, showed excellent development as the series went on, especially in this book. Her path from interesting secondary character to favorite POV character was definitely the highlight for me. I think I might have liked this series more if focused more (or entirely) on Gwenna's journey, and the Kettral. There are just a lot of other subplots in this book that felt slow or seemed to bog down the overall story. <br/><br/>It was as though Mr. Staveley was trying a bit too hard to cram an epic fantasy's world building into a trilogy. I did find some of the politics and theology compelling, just not as much as the idea of an elite fighting force who rode on the backs of monstrous birds.<br/><br/>There was a point in time when I couldn't seem to get enough dark fantasy. All of my favorite books a few years ago fell into that category. Eventually I reached a tipping point though, and started to look for lighter fare. This series is definitely a lot darker than most of the things I've read the last few years. Things get so bleak that I reached a point where I was wondering what exactly I was rooting for at the end. That's a bit too much for me.<br/><br/>Yet despite that, I found it hard to stop listening. I always did want to know what came next. I think that this book does a good job of bringing the conflicts setup in the previous books to a good conclusion.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an enjoyable series despite my complaints. I'll be eager to see what Mr. Staveley has in store for us next.",,,1,,,1,2016/04/07,Audible,Like new,,

His performance is such that this series remains a must audio for me, even if it means waiting a bit longer to get my hands on the next book.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>So I gave this book the same rating as [b:The Emperor's Blades|17910124|The Emperor's Blades (Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne, #1)|Brian Staveley|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1369246817s/17910124.jpg|25095579], and I think in many ways it's better. But I also had higher expectations coming in. I had none for the first book, and found myself pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>So I was looking forward to this. And since I got a review copy that was coming via USPS (twice), I had to wait an extra month to get my hands on it. That further built the anticipation as I watched friends who I had recommended the first one read and highly rate it.<br/><br/>This book started off slow. With how the last one ended, I guess I was sort of expecting the book to hit the ground running. The last book is largely the ""magic school"" trope, although there isn't a whole lot of magic. But there is rigorous training and rivalries and the like. And some of the characters can do magic.<br/><br/>So maybe my love of that trope, or the fact that they were ""in training"" made me less aware of just how STUPID The Emperor's kids are. There was no hiding that here. I'm not a big fan of the super smart, super capable protagonist who can't seem to do any wrong. But I hate the I'm going to pull a plan out of my ass and somehow things will work out mostly right in the end protagonist even worse.<br/><br/>It'd be bad enough if one of them did. But all three of them did. And continued to do it. They didn't learn from their mistakes. They didn't really seem to grow as characters. They just kept being idiots. And selfish. It got pretty frustrating.<br/><br/>So why did I give this 4 stars? Well two reasons mainly. One the story is interesting. The world building Mr. Stavely does in this book is especially intriguing. The pieces he put in place in this novel look to make for a really interesting third (and final?) book in this series.<br/><br/>Secondly he has some great supporting characters. Some are returning from the first novel, and some are new. In particular I really enjoyed the POV chapters from a former supporting character who was given a chance to shine. They were easily my favorite chapters in the book. I only wish they had started sooner. Maybe even in the last book, but it wouldn't have made too much sense, so I understand the reasoning.<br/><br/>So overall this book is better, but with higher expectations, I found myself a bit disappointed at the same time. But I'm looking forward to the next book. I think for a middle book there is a lot to like.  Hopefully the Emperor's kids will get a clue by then.",,,1,,,1,2015/02/18,Review Copy,Like new,,

It starts out with a huge tech dump trying to explain how a Gravity Mirror might be possible. I'm not a physicist so I have no idea how sound the theories are or if he's just completely making things up. <br/><br/>It really seems pointless by the end considering all the other technology that's said to exist with little to no explanation and some of the crazy ways the gravity mirror is used later in the book. I'm fine with ignoring the science, but then he shouldn't have bothered with a few of the infodumps he included in my opinion.<br/><br/>Needless to say it made for a slow start, but I got into it by the third chapter. I actually found myself agreeing with the arguments of the BTC (Bureau of Technology Control), but quickly found myself changing my mind.<br/><br/>The notion of controlling technological advances for the good of humanity is a cool premise, but it really just turns into a ""absolute power corrupts absolutely"" sort of thing.<br/><br/>I felt a few parts went on too long and a few parts were just ridiculous.

Not only is his normal reading voice clear and easy to understand, but he does a variety of voices and accents. His reading definitely added a little extra something to the book. As a first time author, Mr. Staveley lucked out to get such a quality reader. I plan to continue this series in audio as a result.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I'm not sure what in the description made me choose this book to review. Maybe it was simply the fact that it was the first in a series. Since doing so I've seen a bit of buzz about this book, so I was eager to get my hands on my review copy.<br/><br/>This being the first book of a new series, there is a lot of character development and world building to get through. For the most part I think Mr. Staveley does a good job of this, especially as a first time author. However it does suffer from a few slower parts and some predictable twists.<br/><br/>His characters are interesting and have depth. The lore of his world is intriguing. The prologue seems confusing at first, but later on the reader discovers its significance, so just tuck it away for future reference.<br/><br/>For the most part this is the story of two brothers. They just happen to be sons of the Emperor of the largest nation in the world. First there is Kaden, the heir to the throne who is studying with the monks of the Blank God in an isolated monastery. Then there is Valyn, who is training with the Kettral, an elite military force made up of the best of the best.<br/><br/>Both suffer a bit from some of the fantasy school tropes. Valyn especially has his small group of friends and his rival with his group of cronies. However this being a military training facility, things are a lot more serious than bullying in the hallways.<br/><br/>We also get a few chapters with their sister, Adare, who has remained with their father in the capital. These are short, but politically charged. I hope we see a more prominent role from her in the books that follow.<br/><br/>This highlights the main flaw of this book. Like many fantasy books, the women are mostly relegated to secondary characters. They suffer a bit from stereotypes, but I think he does have some strong female characters that just don't receive as much focus as I'd like. In general, the secondary characters are all pretty interesting and have enough depth so as not to be interchangeable. <br/><br/>Each brother's story starts off in very different places but eventually converge with one another at the end. Things really pick up when they do. Strange things are happening around both brothers and they appear to be linked to a conspiracy to kill the emperor and his family. This makes for a lot of politics and conspiracy theories.<br/><br/>One of biggest concerns when reading books in a series is how the author chooses to end it. You need to strike a good balance between leaving the reader wanting more and wrapping up the main conflicts of the book. I think Mr. Staveley does a great job here and I'm looking forward to jumping right into book 2 when it comes out.",,,1,,,1,,,Like new,,

He seems like a cool guy, and I've really wanted to check his books out. I've had this ebook for awhile, but haven't gotten around to it. Since it was a cheap upgrade to get the audio, I decided to go that route.<br/><br/>I haven't read much military fantasy. This is certainly the only modern military fantasy I've read. I think the main reason I enjoyed this book is because at it's core, it's a magic school trope. Magic boot camp really, but close enough. I can't get enough of it. <br/><br/>My main issue was I found the protagonist (and the majority of the characters really) unlikeable. I'm not sure if that was Mr. Cole's intention or not. He definitely seemed to be going for a grey portrayal where who's right and who's wrong isn't always clear. The only characters I found likeable throughout were Marty and Terez.<br/><br/>I have no experience with military culture outside of fiction. Myke Cole does. I'm going to assume he does a good job with that. The lingo and some of the personalities seemed to line up with my expectations. It reinforces my long held thought that I have no business in the military, and makes me appreciate those who serve all the more. I certainly couldn't cut it.<br/><br/>The book was a bit darker than I'd hoped for. I guess that's probably bad expectations on my part. It probably relates back to my general dislike of the protagonist. I understand his struggles with what the right thing to do is, but his selfishness and often times lack of remorse were extremely off putting.<br/><br/>This book brings up a lot of political issues relevant to debates in the US over the actions of the government on personal freedoms, discrimination, use of force, military contractors and in general how to act in an increasingly grey area that is the war on terror. Who are the bad guys here? Do the ends justify the means? I feel like Mr. Cole does a good job in presenting both sides of many of these issues that often left me unsure who/what I was rooting for.<br/><br/>Overall, the concept of military squads of magicians is a cool one, and the magic bootcamp plotline kept me really interested even when I struggled with some of the characters. The book felt fairly self-contained to me, despite being the first book of a trilogy. I think I could stop here and be content. Not that I plan to.

I'd like to see what he does with a better book.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>The start of this book was promising, but things went off the rails. Then, just as they seemed to be recovering, I found the end to be awful. <br/><br/>I think my main problem this book is the characters and their dialogue. In part one of the book Mr. Irvine introduces us to several characters that I despised almost immediately. In part two he seems to be trying to elicit sympathy from the reader via self-pity from internal monologue and sympathetic back story. It might work for some readers, but not for me. At best instead of coming around to like the characters as complex and flawed, I find myself mostly indifferent about what might happen to them.<br/><br/>The main character is mostly likable, although some of her thoughts rubbed me the wrong way. I assume this is another attempt to give her depth through flaws instead of being a hero trope.<br/><br/>Maybe my dislike of almost all the characters is just an inability for me to understand their society, but I doubt it. The most likable characters are minor ones who don't seem to stick around very long. It's really hard for me to enjoy a book when I don't like the people I'm reading about.<br/><br/>The main story is interesting to me though. The world is at war with much more powerful alien creatures. Humanity have built machines called clankers in order to be able to fight back, but they are still mostly outmatched. <br/><br/>At first this seems more like sci-fi than fantasy, but the clankers are powered by crystals and there a mostly unexplained magical system based on them and their connection to power nodes around the world. So really it's some sort of mix that has more of a fantasy feel than sci-fi to me personally.<br/><br/>There are a lot of political and social issues that play into things. With so many young men dying in a seemingly endless war, everyone is expected to produce children to essentially provide the next generation of fodder. Anyone accused of a crime is sent to one of two places depending on their gender. Males are sent to the front lines where they will likely die in short order. Women are sent to ""breeding factories"" which are exactly what they sound like. <br/><br/>Entirely too much time  was spent on the breeding factories, and the notion of a society so desperate to survive they force women to sleep numerous partners in the hopes of producing the most helpful offspring as frequently as possible is downright horrifying to me. <br/><br/>This is apparently the second series of Mr. Irvine's Three Worlds sequence. Having never read the first (The Mirror Quartet), I'm sure I'm missing some references to things from that series. My understanding is this is set hundreds of years later, and possibly on a different world. I never felt lost but it’s possible I would understand more about the crystals and their powers if I had read that series first.<br/><br/>Overall it wasn't a very good book that wasn't as well executed as I'd like. I found myself cringing at some of the writing in places, especially the dialogue. I may still continue on with the second book of the series largely because I already have a review copy, but I need to take a break with another book first. The ending of the book really was really off-putting though. It felt like a bad TV Soap Opera.<br/>",,,1,,,1,,,Like new,,

Taniel is sort of suffering a kind of PTSD that makes him less likable than the first book. His story is still interesting though, and I found this change of character very understandable.<br/><br/>A big change for this book is that instead of having multiple POVs telling part of the same story, the characters are each involved in their own thing which aren't so tightly related. In fact the main characters don't really interact at all.<br/><br/>To me this built a sense of a much larger world than the first book. Things weren't so narrowly focused. You got to see things outside of Andro as well as inside of it.<br/><br/>My only real complaint here is once again the lack of strong women characters. Oh sure they exist in the world, but they are mostly minor characters. Ka-poel is probably my favorite, but she seems relegated to side-kick. Maybe if the mystery surrounding her character was removed by internal dialogue, I wouldn't feel the same though. However, I think Nila, who is the single female POV of the book, is by far the weakest.<br/><br/>This book ends a lot better than the first.

I've been fortunate enough to exchange several emails and discussion posts with Mr. Sullivan over the last few months after discovering his Riyria books late last year.<br/><br/>Fortunate may not be the best word since Mr. Sullivan seems to go out of his way to interact with his fans. I hate writing reviews for books I don't like to begin with, so the notion of writing a review for an author I've actually talked with a bit was weighing on the back of my mind as I set down to read this book. Thankfully I really enjoyed the book, so none of that matters. <br/><br/>The book was a bit slow to start. Ellis Rogers is an unhappy man living in the present day who receives a terminal illness prognosis. Medical technology just isn't ready to solve his illness yet. His solution is to finally use the time machine he's been building in his garage to travel to a time when he can receive the treatment he needs.<br/><br/>So if read that setup as I wrote it, I'd probably not be too interested in reading the book. Thankfully this isn't a book that spends much time dwelling on whether someone (even an MIT graduate) could build a working time machine in his garage in 2014, or any of the other technological advances written about in this book for that matter. If that sort of hard science fiction is what you're looking for, you're going to be disappointed here.<br/><br/>What this book is about really is the nature of humanity. Politics, Religion, and especially love. You know, the stuff you're not really supposed to talk about in many social settings? For this reason alone I think many people may not enjoy this book. Especially those with more conservative leanings.<br/><br/>From my personal experience, most humans are social creatures. Why else would something like Facebook be so popular? They crave attention. Some more than others, but most people seem to need it to at least some degree. People want to be loved. Whether it is the platonic love of friends, the familial love of blood relatives, or romantic love of that special someone. It is our relationships with others that make life worth living.<br/><br/>The other major aspect of this book is what is happiness? Is Mr. Sullivan's Hollow World a utopia? A dystopia? Somewhere in between? A world where there is no more crime, war or disease. No more hunger? No more greed? Does that sound wonderful to you, or downright boring? Maybe a little of both? He also explores what it means to be human and unique. Are genetically engineered genderless clones still human?<br/><br/>I think this makes for both a great and divisive discussion book. Mr. Sullivan does a good job at presenting some of the different arguments, and leaves it to the reader to decide. For me personally I think that nothing is so black and white. The antagonist of this book makes some really good points. He also has some really awful ideas.<br/><br/>I hope that most of his Riyria fans will enjoy this one, but I suspect that won't always be case. I spent a lot more time thinking about the ideas in the book rather than just enjoying the ride. It's not the type of book I'd want to read on a regular basis, but one that I find enjoyable from time to time.",,,1,,,1,2014/03/11,http://riyria.blogspot.com/p/store.html,unspecified,,

A lot of older works I've read are more focused on some cool sci-fi idea and less so on the story. This one was the opposite. It was a cool story with a sci-fi premise.<br/><br/>The idea of telepaths being everywhere sets an interesting backdrop to the question of ""Can you get away with murder when the police can read your mind?""<br/><br/>The protagonist and antagonist I thought were both pretty well developed even if the supporting cast wasn't so much.

His time in ""Hell's Asshole"" still makes me cringe.<br/><br/>This book seems heavily influenced by the Wheel of Time. First we have the Aes Sedai wandering around and we meet the Brown who is more focused on  her scholarship than anything else.<br/><br/>Then the <s>Children of Light</s> show up (I can't remember their actual name, or find it on the damn wiki), with their roving army of Mage Haters.

It would be right at home with all the Dark Fantasy that seems to be abundant these days. This book is way more gruesome in places than most of the so-called ""grimdark"" fantasy I've read recently. This seems to be a book that has gone under the radar of most fantasy fans.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of those man's man kind of books. Caine is a total badass who kills first and doesn't even bother asking questions later. I can imagine a lot of grunting and snarling as I read along.<br/><br/>The female characters are rather thin. They are badass too, but they also bombshells. You won't find a Brienne of Tarth, or Arya Stark here.<br/><br/>If you don't read the description before starting the book, you'll likely be a little taken aback when an assassin in a fantasy novel starts making references to CRTs and Elmer Fudd. It's not bad writing/editing though.<br/><br/>This is really the story of two worlds. A futuristic dystopian Earth, and a fantastical world full of magic called Overworld. Somehow humanity has found a way to send people to Overwold all while allowing the super rich to virtually ""ride along"".<br/><br/>It is the most popular form of entertainment for the privileged class. Watching lower class ""Actors"" fight, kill and often times die for their entertainment. This is no simulation. These are real people who are dying. The ultimate in bloodsport experience.<br/><br/>This is what makes really made the book for me. The parallels between the two worlds, and how the politics and caste system of Earth's impact on the politics of Overworld.<br/><br/>This is no simple revenge story, but one with political undertones. Similarly Caine is no simple thug, but the smart and calculating Hari Michaelson.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed it. The story feels pretty self contained, so while there are other books, I don't feel a need to rush out and read the next one.<br/><br/>It got a little slow in places though. Mr. Stover doesn't seem to write the politics as well as he does gruesome violence and action sequences. That cost it the extra star, but I will definitely be continuing on the series at some point. I'd highly recommend it to any Dark Fantasy fans who like me had never heard of this series/author.",,,1,Fans of Dark Fantasy,,1,2014/02/06,Amazon,Very good,,

I'm still not sure if it's that I simply don't like the book that much, or if I just wasn't in the right mood for it.<br/><br/>There are cool action sequences. I liked some of the sci-fi elements (transferred consciousness, virtual reality) and how they were incorporated into the storyline. I was interested in finding out the reason for the murder/suicide.

However, I found all of his characters unlikable. I prefer character-driven stories. Great characters can carry a weak story a lot better than weak characters can carry a great story for me.<br/><br/>That isn't to say Mr. Hamilton's characters are weak or undeveloped. I just didn't like them. The worst thing an author can do for me is make me not care what happens to the characters. I didn't exactly hate his characters either. If I did, at least I could have rooted for them to meet some sticky end. No, mostly I found myself indifferent.<br/><br/>To me this is a book that had a lot of potential that just failed in execution for me.

My only gripe is that none of them are POV characters, save the least interesting one. Hopefully that will change in the next book. Ka-poel is probably my favorite, and I'm looking forward to understanding more about her as the series goes on.<br/><br/>Mr. McClellan has developed several magic systems whose details aren't really clear at this point in the series, from the Privileged who appear to be more traditional Mages to the bizarre and interesting Powder Mages that the series is named for.<br/><br/>The gunpowder snorting soldiers can do really amazing things with guns and gunpowder in a very unique magic system that stands in contrast to the more traditional Privileged.<br/><br/>This book was a little slow to grab me. It might be because Mr. McClellan has set up numerous subplots that seem to go off in several directions that may turn some people off as slow or confusing. <br/><br/>Personally I enjoyed them all, even if the pacing maybe suffers a bit as a result. We've got the grizzled and hardened commander Tamas, who leads a coup and execution of the nobility including the King making for politics and intrigue. Spies and Assassins.<br/><br/>Then there is his son Taniel, who appears to have a Gunpowder problem that makes me think of Coke-head. He's in pursuit of a powerful Privileged who killed many of his father's Powder Mages that leads to him being on the front lines of an invasion and the threat of ancient powers.<br/><br/>Finally there is the investigator Adamat who starts by investigating a cryptic prophecy uttered by every Privileged in the King's cabal as they lay dying.<br/><br/>Many of these story lines are left lingering as the book stops more than it ends. I'm left with more questions that have me eager for the next book, but some may find the ending unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>Overall an enjoyable read. 3.5 Stars rounded up since it's his first novel.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I was however wondering if we'd ever meet the occasionally mentioned, but never seen Sabetha anytime soon.<br/><br/>This book delivers that in spades. In fact possibly a little too much to the detriment of the other characters. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy her character, and hope we'll see a lot more from her in the future, but I could have used some more with Jean and the other Bastards.<br/><br/>The others? Yes, about half of this novel is a series of flashbacks much like the first novel where we finally learn about Sabetha and her relationship with Locke. I found these parts the better of the two stories. Maybe it was the (albeit brief) appearance of Chains, or the twins. I'm not really sure.<br/><br/>For the present day story Locke and Jean are compelled to take their hand at politics, and you'll never guess who they are up against?<br/><br/>The writing is once again excellent. I've heard complaints about the pacing, but I didn't find that an issue. In fact I found it much easier to get into this one than I did with the start of [b:Red Seas Under Red Skies|887877|Red Seas Under Red Skies (Gentleman Bastard, #2)|Scott Lynch|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1291336119s/887877.jpg|856785].<br/><br/>There is once again a slew of hilarious (and often inappropriate to repeat) conversations and one-liners. I often had to pause my reading to set down my book to control my laughter.<br/><br/>My major issue is the main story in many ways felt like more of the same. Locke is supposed to be this criminal genius, yet he always seems not just one or two steps behind, but way behind his opposition. Maybe it's because I read all three books in close proximity, but I found it frustrating at points.<br/><br/>That said, it was still a fun ride most of the way and I'll be eagerly waiting now for the fourth book in the series.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The beginning was painfully slow. It seemed like little happened and Mr. Lynch was determined to describe everything in minute details.<br/><br/>A lot of what did happen seemed like a rehash of the first book in a new city and not nearly as fun.<br/><br/>Locke and Jean are dealing with the aftermath of the first book and things aren't going well. Like the last book this book mixes chapters of the present with flashback chapters filling in the reader on past events as they are relevant to the current story. I still think this works well.<br/><br/>Thankfully somewhere in the middle or so the book takes a turn. We have ships, and pirates, and of course plots within plots.<br/><br/>This book adds some greatly needed female characters, and provides interesting superstitions about sailing a boat without female officers and cats. Cats? Yeah, though kittens seem preferred.<br/><br/>The humor and the relationship of Jean and Locke continue, albeit under even more strain than the last novel.

This was partly due to various chores and activities I had to finish that allowed me the opportunity to get extra listening in, and partly due to my desire to finish the story.<br/><br/>While I found it enjoyable, it's ending was mostly predictable, and I didn't think it was as strong as the previous novel.<br/><br/>One of the aspects of all the books in this trilogy that I didn't hit upon in my previous reviews is the heavy use of Christian allegory.<br/><br/>A key concept to the series is that your ability to channel ""the Medium"" is largely related to your belief in it. This relates to the notion of giving your will over to that of the Medium and faith that it will protect and bless you if you do so. Many of the abilities of the medium may only be used to the benefit of others and not oneself.<br/><br/>There is also a large theme of life after death, and resurrection of the dead. While these themes are present throughout the whole trilogy, they weren't as much at the forefront as they were in this book. The plot of this novel largely revolves around testing the main character Lea's faith in the Medium.<br/><br/>I'm reluctant to throw out the term ""Deus ex Machina"" because I feel that all the events fall within the explained abilities of the Medium and someone who is strong with it being able to perform those actions. I could see someone making a good case for it however.<br/><br/>Overall, I think Mr. Wheeler does a good job of wrapping things up with a neat bow. There is certainly room for future stories in the world of Muirwood. <br/><br/>The author's note indicated he has a novella  called <a href=""http://www.jeff-wheeler.com/?p=28"">Maia</a> taking place many years after this trilogy available on his website. I believe he wrote it prior to completing any of the Muirwood books however.",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

It has just enough detail to follow the story without being overwhelming.

To the FBI, unless they physically stole something, destroyed something or cost your millions of dollars, it wasn't worth pursuing.<br/><br/>How do you quantify computer time? Especially back then when computers weren't affordable and resources were limited. What about the time Cliff Stoll spend tracking the hacker? Time he should have spent doing his job.

So much so that they distinguish between normal Orphans and Wretcheds (Orphans whose parentage is unknown).<br/><br/>Wretched are often abandoned to the various Abbey's around the world and sheltered until they turn 18, at which point they must make their way in the world.<br/><br/>Wretched's take their last names from their assigned role. Our protagonist, Lia Cook, a young girl of 13, has been assigned to work in the kitchens.

It's a short book, so there isn't a lot of world building. We learn things as Lea does.<br/><br/>This is the first book I've read by Mr. Wheeler. His writing style doesn't jump out at me as exceptional, but it is well done. His characters have reasonable depth for such a short book and varying personalities.<br/><br/>The magic system feels original to me, based on various statues referred to as ""Leerings"" by commoners, or Gargoyles by the learned. They are carved for a specific action based on an element (water, fire, etc) and are meant as a focus to use ""The Medium"".<br/><br/>The ending is a bit predictable, but as this is rather short story, I still found it enjoyable and have already jumped into the second book.",,,1,,Jenny Colvin,1,,,unspecified,,

I discovered him about 8 years ago, and quickly devoured his Dresden Files books. Then I moved right into his Codex Alera series. For three blissful years there was a Dresden Files book in April and a Codex Alera book in December.<br/><br/>Upon completing Codex Alera, Mr. Butcher's pace seemed to slow. I found the books as good as ever, or possibly even better, just far less frequent. At first it may anger fans of the Dresden Files that Mr. Butcher is writing something else. I'm here to tell you it shouldn't.<br/><br/>This book is excellent. I'd be surprised if any fans of Mr. Butcher don't also enjoy this. And hey, maybe writing two series at the same time will get us more excellent books to enjoy in a shorter period of time. It seems to have worked well for him in the past.<br/><br/>When I first heard of this series, my initial reaction was, Steampunk? Really? I must admit that I never really saw the appeal. I haven't read a lot of the genre, but what little I had read until recently didn't seem to be for me. My second thought was Well, I'd read Jim Butcher Twilight fan fiction if that's what he wanted to write. <br/><br/>The action starts almost right from the beginning. The pace is furious, with very few points of slowing. There was never a good stopping point in my listening and I always hated to put it down. To me that's what separates a 5 star rating from a solid 4.<br/><br/>We are quickly introduced to several characters. First we meet Gwen Lancaster, a young noblewoman determined to join the Spire Ark's guard. I had a bit of a mixed reaction to her. There were times I found her frustrating, but it's good to have a variety of characters, and Gwen helps to round things out nicely. <br/><br/>Next we meet Grim, the Captain of the airship Predator and various members of his crew. Grim is very much of the vein of Harry Dresden, though I see bit of Bernard from Codex Alera in him as well. He's easily likeable, but far from the best character in my opinion.<br/><br/>Bridget Targwen and her cat Rawl come next. Both are fantastic, especially Rawl. All of the cats are excellent, but especially Rawl. Mr. Butcher's cats are a bit reminiscent to me of those in Robin Hobb's Tawny Man Trilogy. He seems to nail cats exactly. And apparently the internet is crazy for cats, so instant bestseller, right?<br/><br/>Finally we meet Master Etherialist Ferris, and his apprentice Folly. Folly is absolutely my favorite! She reminds me a bit of Luna Lovegood. All of her scenes are highly entertaining. She's probably considered more of a secondary character to the first three, but I hope she continues to play a large role in the future books.<br/><br/>And if that's not enough there are several other secondary and tertiary characters that are all quite good, such as Gwen's cousin Benedict, members of the Predator: Creedy, Kettle and Journeyman and the Spire Ark himself: Lord Albion. <br/><br/>The antagonists are a bit cartoonish at times, especially Cavendish, but the two main Auroan soldiers felt more nuanced though.<br/><br/>This story is very character-driven, but Mr. Butcher has created a pretty interesting world for them to inhabit. There is very little steam powered anything though. Instead the main resource of note are Ethereal crystals. They power everything from Airships to hand weapons referred to as gauntlets.<br/><br/>Explanations for the world and magic systems are slowly metered out as the book goes on, but there were thankfully few info dumps. Or if there were, I was too busy enjoying myself to notice.<br/><br/>The book is fairly well self contained. Things end in a pretty good spot, especially considering this is the first book in a series. There are plenty of questions left to be answered, but most of the main conflicts of this book are either resolved, or put on hold nicely.<br/><br/>Overall if you enjoy Mr. Butcher other work, or enjoy character-driven faced paced action packed stories, pick this one up. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>Now I will once again eagerly have to await the next book in two series by Mr. Butcher, much like when I first discovered him. How lucky for us all!",,,1,,,1,2015/09/12,Review Copy,Like new,,

Unlike that book however, I didn't find myself confused and frustrated at the beginning. I was simply uninterested. So unlike Midnight Tides where I enjoyed the story once I got my bearings, this one just kept leaving me bored for far too much of the book.<br/><br/>One of the flaws I often see in Epic fantasy is introducing too many characters and subplots that it bogs the story down. This is the main fault I found with the Wheel of Time series that could badly use editing to make books 8-10 into 1 or 2 much tighter novels.<br/><br/>This one isn't quite at that extreme, but I hope that things turn around with [b:Toll the Hounds|938544|Toll the Hounds (Malazan Book of the Fallen, #8)|Steven Erikson|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1316126179s/938544.jpg|3898730].<br/><br/>The Letherii/Tiste Edur story just isn't that interesting to me. Maybe it's because I find almost no likable characters in the bunch apart from Tehol and Bugg. All of the new characters, especially the Patriotists are despicable. <br/><br/>That's all well and good, but I feel Mr. Erikson spends entirely too much time convincing just how despicable they are.

Old favorites like Fiddler and Quick Ben and the banter of the Marines are a relief from the tedium that is the Letherii/Edur story.<br/><br/>Mr. Erikson seems to always write really terrible beginnings (even though I know he's capable of writing good ones) but really excellent endings. This one is no different. However I won't let another strong ending fool me into forgetting about how bored I was for far too much of this novel.<br/><br/>There were enough enjoyable chapters in this book to save it from a 2-star rating, but overall this has been the weakest novel in the series for me so far.

We're also introduced to a very small number of new ones that quickly fell into that ""love to hate"" category for me. You know a writer is doing a good job when you start hoping he'll kill someone off.<br/><br/>The chapters alternated between Darujhistan and people outside it. The Darujhistan were far more enjoyable for me, but those other chapters became moreso as the book went on.<br/><br/>I feel like I've come home again to the Phoenix Inn and caught up with old friends.

I enjoyed that book all the way through.<br/><br/>No book in the series so far has shown this fact more than this one. I was about ready to quit the book in frustration. He introduced what seemed like 20 new characters in the span of maybe 2 chapters. This book has all of one character in it from the previous 4 books. And he was a relatively minor character that I was pretty indifferent towards. None of it made much sense to me.<br/><br/>I'm apparently not the typical Malazan fan in this. Everyone else seems to enjoy being thrown into the deep end at the start of each book. I don't. I'm pretty tired of it by now as my rant may indicate. I just don't get why all the hardcore Malazan fans do. I guess that means I'll never be one of them. Then again there are still 5 more books to go.<br/><br/>I'm really enjoying this series so far, but Mr. Erikson seems to go out of his way to alienate potential fans in my opinion. I don't mind all the layering and complex foreshadowing he does. I certainly don't get even a third of it, but it doesn't bother me. It just makes me feel pretty dumb/unobservant in a group reading setting.<br/><br/>OK, now that I got that off my chest. This book is sort of odd. The whole thing is a flash back. It's hard to say exactly when it occurs. It seems like the near past. I feel like this story might better have been told earlier in the series. Maybe it's beginning would have frustrated me less then, but probably not.<br/><br/>There are some really great characters in this book though. They are largely responsible for my enjoyment of this book. Mr. Erikson seems to have this obsession with pairs of characters, and Tehol and Bugg are now only second to Quick Ben and Kalam as my favorites.<br/><br/>Iron Bars is probably now one of my favorites as well. I wish we had gotten to see more of him in this book that we did. Hopefully we'll see more of him later in the series.<br/><br/>This book is much less action-packed than the previous four. There is a lot more politics in this one. That doesn't make it any less gruesome and dark.

This book contains most of my favorite characters, many of which are together again. I'm especially partial to the scenes of Quick Ben and Kalam, of which this book has many. Not only that, but they are hanging out with Fiddler as well.<br/><br/>Things with the Crippled God are heating up and things are looking bleaker for the soldiers of the Malazan's 14th.<br/><br/>I finally feel like I have a handle on the series, and while the start of this book introduces some new characters, I didn't feel like I was thrown into the deep end with this one like I did with [b:Midnight Tides|345299|Midnight Tides (Malazan Book of the Fallen, #5)|Steven Erikson|http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1366996057s/345299.jpg|3898719].<br/><br/>My only complaint is that Mr. Erikson likes to conceal things from the reader beyond what seems necessary. It's one thing to have information withheld from the reader when the point of view character doesn't know it. It's quite another when he does things like playing the pronoun game with characters we already know or don't allow us to hear a conversation that the point of view character is involved in.<br/><br/>This series is complicated enough with a huge amount of depth. This just seems overkill and the reason I can't give this book a 5 star rating.<br/><br/>Still this has been the most enjoyable of the series thus far. I rushed a bit ahead of the <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/85396-the-malazan-fallen"">Malazan Fallen</a> group to finish a week early.

While there are some lighter moments to interrupt the violence, this book has some truly disturbing scenes.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b> <br/>I found the beginning of this book very frustrating. Just when I felt like I had a pretty good handle on things we shift not only location, but get almost entirely a new set of characters to learn.<br/><br/>If not for my <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/85396-the-malazan-fallen"">Group Read</a>, I might have considered taking a break.<br/><br/>I read for fun, not to be frustrated. I don't normally like to have to work so hard for something in my free time. I honestly don't know if I'd enjoy this outside of a group setting. <br/><br/>The confusion level I felt while reading this did make for great discussion though. I found it reassuring that even the re-readers were confused on certain points.<br/><br/>Mr. Erikson does seem to reward your patience and careful reading. As the book went on, and I started getting used to this new cast of characters, my frustration greatly lessened. This book started as 3 starts but slowly rose to 4 stars.<br/><br/>There are 4 main plot lines with a few side lines that diverge and converge as the story goes on. <br/><br/>My favorite was the story of Kalam, who was one of the few characters in the first book to appear in this one. Maybe it's because I've always gravitated towards rogues and ranger types in RPGs that I found his story so interest.<br/><br/>You learn a little bit more about his past, and find out just how badass a well trained assassin can be. Kalam in on a self-appointed mission for the good of the Empire, or so he believes.<br/><br/>The other major plotline of this book was from the perspective of Duiker, the Imperial Historian as he chronicles the months long evacuation of ""The Chain of Dogs"", Malazan refugees fleeing for their lives, in the midst of a great rebellion of the Seven Cities.<br/><br/>This leads to some of most gruesome battle scenes I have ever encountered. Mr. Erikson makes no attempt to sugar coat the horrors of war.<br/><br/>The final two fairly major plot lines in this book are enjoyable as well, but both of them tie back to the two I highlighted. Their cast of characters were interesting (and one of the two groups contained all the rest of the characters that appeared in the first two books). I felt like these were mostly interludes to the other action though. <br/><br/>The book comes to a reasonable stopping point, though if this were a stand alone book I'd find myself with too many questions to be satisfied by it.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to recommend this to someone to read on their own. If you don't mind working for your reward, or have someone you can read/discuss this with, and are not offput by gruesome and disturbing scenes it's another good entry in what so far has been a mostly enjoyable series.<br/><br/>I'm also a bit nervous about starting [b:Memories of Ice|175983|Memories of Ice (Malazan Book of the Fallen, #3)|Steven Erikson|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1316729348s/175983.jpg|836462] that I'll get frustrated all over again.

It could just be the plot of this one is more compelling. Whatever the reason, this is was a really great book for me.<br/><br/>We are finally introduced what appears to be the main antagonist. The Malazans now set their sights East and a new war brewing from the new empire of the Pannion Domin.<br/><br/>Now instead of being the invading force in Genabackis, Dujek and Whiskeyjack are leading the Malazans and his Bridgeburners to defend some of the coastal cities.<br/><br/>They are unable to do this alone. Alliances must be forged, and people rallied. The horrors of the Pannion Domin make the previous fights over first Pale and later Darujhistan seem like a walk in the park by comparison.<br/><br/>Quick Ben is easily my favorite character in the series so far, and he gets even more bad-ass in this book. When living in a world of constant war, gods and demi-gods, it takes a certain kind arrogance for a human to throw himself in with the big boys and expect to triumph.<br/><br/>A great new addition to the cast was Gruntle, caravan leader. His story starts off on the slow side, but really gains momentum as the book progresses.<br/><br/>This book also offers more insight into many characters who were on the periphrial in [b:Gardens of the Moon|55399|Gardens of the Moon (The Malazan Book of the Fallen, #1)|Steven Erikson|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1355144064s/55399.jpg|2646042].

The first ""book"" is not only 25% of the novel, it all focuses on one character. Karsa Orlong is not a very likable character.

At first. Once again everything isn't so black and white, and I found myself changing my mind on some of the characters.<br/><br/>Mr. Erikson seems to have a fondness for duos, as there have been many such pairs throughout the series so far. One of the newer ones I've come to enjoy in this book is that of the Claw Pearl and Lostara Yil. We are also once again rewarded with more Iskaral Pust and Mogora, which offer some pretty amusing dialogues.<br/><br/>The only thing that detracted from this book for me was the story of Trull Sengar and Onrack. I just found myself indifferent and eager to get through there parts. It wasn't that I didn't like them, every good story needs unlikable characters. I just didn't care.

Since this is comparison I hear a lot, I figure I'll give my a review as a sort of compare and contrast for anyone else out there whose loves Dresden and are considering these books.<br/><br/>I'm a little underwhelmed. I always tell people to give Dresden a few books before it really gets good.

I read the description, and some of the reviews, and wasn't too impressed and moved on.<br/><br/>Fast forward about 6 months and a few of my newly made GR friends were making a group to do a series re-read. A few others decided to join in as first timers. I was convinced to give the series a try.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did. I can't say how I'll feel after all 10 books, but after the first one, I'm hooked!<br/><br/>The <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/85396-the-malazan-fallen"">group</a> is probably a large part of my enjoyment. I can see this book being very hard to read by yourself. There were a few parts that confused the hell out of me, that were explained to me by people who had been there before.<br/><br/>I'm very much a go with the flow and enjoy the ride type of reader. I'm OK if things don't make sense right away, so long as I get there eventually. Everything that confused me at the start was cleared up by the end. I'm not 100% if that was all book, or our great <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/85396-the-malazan-fallen"">group discussion</a>, but it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>The book certainly has left me with a lot of questions to be answered, but that's to be expected as the start of a 10 book series.<br/><br/>Mr. Erikson is an excellent writer. His descriptions, characters and language are all top notch. My only (minor) complaint would be that he sometimes seems intent on showing you just how good his vocabulary is.<br/><br/>The highlight for me is the character development. This book involves some very powerful people. And just when you think ""wow, what a badass"", someone more powerful shows up. I don't know if Dues Ex Machina possible when the gods themselves are part of the cast.<br/><br/>He also paints a very grey picture. One or two chapters in, I started to feel I knew who was ""good"" and who was ""bad"". Five chapters in, I had to re-evaluate my  initial assessments. I wouldn't be surprised if 2 books in, I re-asses them again.<br/><br/>Mr. Erikson introduces an interesting magical system with his use of Warrens. Unlike Brandon Sanderson who gives you a lot of detail and rules about how magic works, at least through 1 book the details are quite murky.<br/><br/>All and all, a great start to the series. It's a 4, but it's a very high 4, and the ending almost pushes it to a 5 for me.

I don't know what it will take to finally force a change, but meanwhile innocent consumers continue to have their lives upended by it.<br/><br/>I didn't find this book too technical, though given my background, I'm usually a bad judge of these things. I think anyone who understands the basics of the internet would be able to follow along.

Instead of the young farmboy being whisked away on an adventure to save the world, we have a young street urchin named Azoth, who aspires to become the apprentice to the best Wetboy in the city Durzo Blint.<br/><br/>The book has some pretty good action, and an interesting magic system that I don't really understand at this point.

I couldn't get enough of it. Lately though, I've been wanting a change of pace. My plan for this year was to branch back out into other genres because I read far too much fantasy last year.

Oops.<br/><br/>This book has a lot of negativity around it. When it was announced the thread was full of people who seemed determined to convince the rest of us how bad it was. Most of their argument seemed to revolve around how derivative of Tolkien it was, and that part didn't bother me at all. I also found it not nearly as similar as people were saying. Maybe it were, I might have enjoyed it more.<br/><br/>[b:The Eye of the World|228665|The Eye of the World (Wheel of Time, #1)|Robert Jordan|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1337818095s/228665.jpg|2008238] is one of my favorite books, and probably the book that really made me love epic fantasy. So reading it at the same time, didn't really help this book's cause. Then again, I think I would have struggled with it regardless.<br/><br/>My main issues are the pacing and the quality of the writing. The story itself was fine, though nothing particularly great. It seems as though this book was all about hurry up and wait. Pages and pages would go by where it felt like nothing was really happening. They were walking somewhere or talking about, well I can't remember what at this point, but it didn't feel important to the plot. Then something interesting would happen and it would be over really quickly. I wish he had spent more time on plot developments and less time moving his characters around.<br/><br/>As to the writing, I'm not someone who needs brilliant prose to enjoy a book. Most of my favorite authors will never been awarded for their literary techniques. I'm even pretty forgiving to first time authors. The thing is, if you're writing is lacking, you need to make up for it with entertainment value. And this book just didn't. I found myself paying more attention to the words on the page than the story they were trying to tell. His constant repetition of descriptive phrases like ""The Valeman"", ""The borderman"" and ""The Northmen"" became a huge annoyance as the book went on.<br/><br/>The characters and the world building were nothing special either. I didn't really care about either. I've been mostly enjoying the Shannara TV show, which is apparently based on [b:The Elfstones of Shannara|189783|The Elfstones of Shannara  (The Original Shannara Trilogy, #2)|Terry Brooks|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1420148388s/189783.jpg|2121201]. The world building there seems more apparent and interesting here. We get maybe one small part where Allanon is info dumping about the past to give you any sense that this a post-apocalyptic version of our world (or one much like it) rather some standard fantasy world based on medieval Europe. <br/><br/>What's strange is that Elfstones seems to feature female characters quite a bit, while this one makes them feel like an afterthought. How do people still exist without women? Oh they are there after all? Who knew? We go probably 500 pages before a women is even mentioned, let alone has lines. This is far from the only fantasy book with this issue, but it struck me odd after the show having several.<br/><br/>Overall I think if this book had been 200-300 pages shorter and focused more on plot, world building or character development instead of moving characters around I'd have enjoyed it a lot more. I'm not sure if I'll try the next book or not. There is just too much to read, and not enough time and this one hasn't really motivated me to continue.",,,1,,,1,2016/01/31,Amazon,Good,,

For me the best villains are the ones who aren't evil, but simply those whose goals conflict with the protagonists and are willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish them. The power/money hungry antagonist thing just really is tired and should be dropped from an author's toolbox.<br/><br/>The magic system is quite interesting, but poorly introduced. I don't need/want some big info dump about the magic and how it works, but I don't like hand waving magic either that seems to be a plot device the author is making up as he goes along. The reality is that the magic system does have some well defined rules, but as a first time reader none of that is very clear until far too deep into the book in my opinion. Mr. Weeks goes a little too far in his efforts to show and not tell.<br/><br/>I definitely warmed up to this book by the end. There are things to like here despite all my complaints. The magic system is a lot better once you know a bit more about it. The world building is interesting and makes for some good political conflicts.<br/><br/>If Mr. Weeks didn't keep interrupting the main plot for what often felt like juvenile wish fulfillment scenes, I might have given this a 3.5 and rounded it up to a 4.<br/><br/>I""m not sure if I'll continue on in the series, but the fact that one of my favorite narrators, [a:Simon Vance|5602|Simon Vance|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1240014151p2/5602.jpg] takes over reading duties for the next one, and that this book got better as it went along are all points in it's favor.",,,1,,,1,2013/12/22,Amazon,Like new,,

Stealing from guards and breaking all the rules of the ""Silent Peace"" that has been established between Capa Barvosi (the Godfather) and the Nobility.<br/><br/>I really love the structure of this book. That's not something I usually comment on in my reviews, but it's really worth bringing up here. There is a fairly beefy prologue set in the past where we get a little background on our protagonist. Then in chapter 1 we are in present day with an adult version of Locke and his Gentleman Bastard friends.<br/><br/>It then alternates with Interludes flashing back to the past and filling in details about Locke and his friends lives. The interludes get short and eventually skipped in some places as the present day story really gets going.<br/><br/>It was well executed. I didn't find myself grumbling when an interlude came up interrupting the main story. It always added something important, and I liked how they got shorter as the book went on.<br/><br/>The characters are really great. Locke and Jean are probably the most developed, but the supporting characters are all interesting and feel to have depth. I'd really love to get more details on his master and founder of the Gentleman Bastards, Chains. He seems to have lived an interesting life, and what we did of his past left me wanting more.<br/><br/>It is once again another series where it seems like the Mages are assholes. That's probably more realistic. If you could do magic and were more powerful than most people, would you really be as benevolent as Gandalf? I think most people would end up like Saruman instead, and in this series we have a whole guild full of them.<br/><br/>The rules of the magic seem non-existent. It's hard to know just what a Mage is capable of, but it's pretty damn impressive, and scary. These are not people you want to mess with.<br/><br/>I've marked this as grimdark, but while there are some truly awful things in it, it's not as dark as some of the other stuff I've been reading. It's more of an adventure/caper story than anything else.<br/><br/>I finished the book a day earlier than I had planned, and if I hadn't been so busy last weekend, I might have finished it even sooner.

The jury is still out, but it looks like I might have done a poor job. I enjoyed the reread, but this book won't be for everyone.<br/><br/>I've always been fascinated by the early days of computers and the internet, especially where computer cracking is involved. The late 70s and the 80s were basically the wild west. The idea of networked computers was so new that government was slow to react to those who took advantage. <br/><br/>When they did finally react, it was often to an extreme, which I think is evident in some of the treatment Mr. Mitnick receives from law enforcement. Some of the rumors that developed around him over the years were pretty ludicrous. Not all of them however, and he could be a scary person to cross.<br/><br/>I've read many books on the subject over the years. It's one of the few non-fiction subjects I'm interested in enough to read on my own away from school assigned reading. I even wrote a term paper on it in High School. How I managed to convince my teacher to let me read a bunch of books on computer crime, I don't really remember at this point.<br/><br/>It's hard to read about computer crime and not come across Kevin Mitnick. He's arguably the most famous, or at least the most notorious computer ""hacker"" of his time.<br/><br/>I find it interesting that Mr. Mitnick has embraced the new definition of Hacker. In fact he doesn't even bother to explain the difference. Back when he was active he would have been considered more of a Phone Phreak (which he does cover a bit) or a Cracker.<br/><br/>Hacker used to be a nickname for obsessive computer types that would dig into depths of systems and code looking for the nooks and crannies.<br/><br/>Maybe he chooses to call himself a Hacker because he's trying to appeal to a wider audience that wouldn't know the difference. Or maybe it's because he doesn't seem to feel like what he did was all that wrong, and might self identify with the original definition.<br/><br/>While Mr. Mitnick's computer skills are no doubt impressive, I think most of his success can be attributed more to his Social Engineering skills rather than his technical ability. That and his ability to exploit the things he learns.<br/><br/>Social Engineering for those unfamiliar, can be defined as <i>the art of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information</i>. <br/><br/>It essentially a different way of saying to con someone, or the term used where computers and/or technology is involved. It relies heavily on knowledge of your targets security procedures and vulnerabilities. Often time people are the weakest link in computer security.<br/><br/>Most of what Mr. Mitnick does is built on the work of others, exploiting bugs found by other people and the trusting and/or lazy nature of people rather than discovering new flaws on his own.<br/><br/>He manages to obtain the source code for numerous operating systems over the years, but often time doesn't bother to spend any time looking at the code, he simply obtains it like a trophy.<br/><br/>I can only theorize that he's incredibly charismatic. Reading this book he doesn't come off as a very likable person to me, yet people seem to jump to help him, even as he abuses their trust and love. That's probably part of why he's so successful at Social Engineering.<br/><br/>One of my friends describe the book as repetitive. For someone not interested in the technology aspect, I can see how this is true. At a high level he used a lot of the same techniques to break into more and more complex systems, especially as the level of computer knowledge and security practices continued to evolve over the years.<br/><br/>He tries to explain the various technical terms as he goes, and I had no trouble following what he wrote, but I was already familiar with a lot of the stuff ahead of time. <br/><br/>It might get tedious or frustrating to those without any background. Similarly it might get tedious to those with more technical knowledge as he explains what may seem like basic concepts.<br/><br/>The book seems to toggle between him trying to elicit sympathy from the reader for his exploits, and apologizing to the people he wronged over the years, especially his mother and grandmother.<br/><br/>To be fair, a lot of incorrect and overly negative things were published about Mr. Mitnick over the years, while he was legally prevented from telling his side of things.<br/><br/>Like I said in my original review, I'm sure the truth is somewhere in the middle of the two extremes.<br/><br/>Despite the negatives, his story is an incredibly unique, and to me at least an interesting one. Parts of it read like it's straight from a spy novel. He uses his abilities not only to hide from his pursuers, but to spy on them to see how close they are getting.<br/><br/>In the end his ego, and his inability to stop breaking into computer systems proves to be his downfall. He may not think so, but considering the fear he elicited in those pursuing and prosecuting him, he was incredibly lucky to come away like he did, and now to have a successful business where people pay him to do the kinds of things he went to jail for.<br/><br/><br/><b>------------------Original Review------------------</b><br/>Forgot to add this book. I noticed after putting another book on my shelves.<br/><br/> I recall really enjoying this. After reading several books biased against Mitnick, it was nice to contrast that with something biased for him instead.<br/><br/>It's hard to know what really happened. I'm sure it lies somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/> Either way, it is a pretty interesting read and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in computers, or social engineering. It really is scary the kinds of things he can do.",,,2,,,1,,,Like new,,

He does several voices and accents that helped move along what could often be a rather slow plot.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>A friend of mine introduced me to Simon R. Green with his Nightside series a few years back. I didn't read a lot back then, but I would generally pick up the new one he had out every year. I rated them all 3 star books save for [b:A Hard Day's Knight|8288919|A Hard Day's Knight (Nightside, #11)|Simon R. Green|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1279637066s/8288919.jpg|13137384], which I really liked. However, they were short and mostly fun reads that didn't require much thought. Mind Candy.<br/><br/>The protagonist of this series makes a cameo at the end of that one, so I've always been meaning to check this out as a possible replacement. I got a good deal on it from audible, and I needed something to fill about a week or so of audio so it seemed the perfect time.<br/><br/>Like Nightside this is another Urban Fantasy series. However instead of a detective protagonist, this one has a ""secret agent"" as the lead. James Bond, but with mostly magical gadgets rather than technological ones. In fact his cover name is Shaman Bond.<br/><br/>The book titles of this series are all parodies of Bond titles. Mr. Green always likes to poke fun at tropes in his writing. With this one he's mocking both spy novels and fantasy tropes by combining the two.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the book just isn't as good, or if my tastes have changed as I've become a more voracious reader the past few years. The humor was still good, the plot was light. It just wasn't working for me.<br/><br/>It felt too long. My recollection was that most of the Nightside books were ~250 pages each, while this is closer to 400 I believe. It's over 17 hours in audio. That’s probably at least 5 hours too long.<br/><br/>There were too many dead-ends in the story. I recall Mr. Green writing scenes in Nightside that seemed unimportant to the plot but that explore some bizarre idea he must have had. This book has entirely too much of that. I think if a few of them had been cut out/saved for later books this might have been a better story.<br/><br/>It's possible these books get better as they go along. There were parts I enjoyed, and the ending was pretty good to bump it from a 2.5 to a solid 3, but I'm not likely to continue on at this point.<br/>",,,1,,,1,,Audible,Like new,,

I thought the characters were well developed. You share a sense of concern with the protagonist for the motivations of the others.

I presume it was done to draw the user in and present them with engaging questions. I just mostly found it confusing. <br/><br/>This technique seems to be overused in TV these days, so that might be why I'm particularly sensitive to it.<br/><br/>I flipped back to re-read the beginning a few times once I was further in the book to remind myself what happened to try to piece things back together. Overall this is a minor gripe on my part though.<br/><br/>The first part of the book moved a bit slow for my liking. Some of the detail Jaffe used to set up the main character felt a bit drawn out.<br/><br/>I was also a little underwhelmed by the primary ending (there are some things that occur after the ""big reveal"", but it's mostly prologue).

I think this is one of those books that choosing between reading or listening is more a matter of which works best for you rather more than anything else.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I feel kind of bad. I had been looking forward to reading this book for awhile. The concept of the magic system sounded really cool.<br/><br/>I was looking for something fun and light to hold me over between books. This seemed like it might fit the bill.<br/><br/>Overall however, I was underwhelmed. I blame [a:Jim Butcher|10746|Jim Butcher|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1400640324p2/10746.jpg]. For me, everything seems to pale compared to the Dresden Files.<br/><br/>The other problem I had was it seemed like a generic Urban Fantasy series with stock vampires. Or mostly stock. Mr. Hines does work in a large variety based on various popular vampire novels over the year, including the sparkly variety that have pretty much have ruined what little interest in vampires I once had.<br/><br/>The main character seems generic too. Well except that he's a librarian instead of private eye or some sort of field agent. This may appeal to the librarians out there, but I'm not sure who else.<br/><br/>The second half of the book was a lot better however. Thankfully the whole thing wasn't about vampires. We also got more with the magic system, which is really the only thing that makes this book stand out. <br/><br/>Mr. Hines has come up an interesting and certainly unique system. Pulling magic items out of books. My only gripe is that while some things are explicitly named (Harry Potter, Doctor Who), other things are only alluded to (Star Wars). I'm not sure if it's over copyright concerns or what. If so that's yet another negative side effect of copyright. There is no way I'd confuse this book with a Star Wars book, simply because a character pulls a lightsabre out of a book. I mean who WOULDN'T do that if you had the ability?<br/><br/>Overall I think this is a book that will largely depend on how much you enjoy Urban Fantasy. If you're a fan, this may be a book to check out. If not, I don't think the strength of the magic system is enough to compensate for the mostly generic Urban Fantasy story.",,,1,,,1,2014/02/10,Audible,Like new,,

I read it sometime in high school. I don't exactly remember when. However, I remember seeing the movie the first time vividly. I was not quite 11 years old. The perfect age really. I convinced my mother to take me to see it while my sister was away at camp. The movie both fascinated and terrified me. It's one of the few movies that have stuck with me so vividly over the years.<br/><br/>By the time I got to reading the book I was a bit older, and that same sense of wonder had started to wear off. I was too young to enjoy the pseudo-science, and the action in my imagination just didn't live up to my memories of the movie. It was a good book, but ""the movie was better"".<br/><br/>With the 25th anniversary last year, a new audiobook got released, and I was interested to revisit the book. It was a lot better than I remember. I enjoyed the ""science"" better this time around, although the computer related stuff made me go: ""Yeah that's what you get for tampering with such a complex system"" a lot.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since I've seen the movie now, and I plan to revisit it. This seems like one of those rare movies that doesn't tweak too much from the book. It's almost as though Mr. Crichton wrote it to be made into a movie. It wouldn't surprise me to learn that was true.<br/><br/>My favorite Crichton book is [b:Timeline|7669|Timeline|Michael Crichton|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1405420745s/7669.jpg|1525987] (whose movie adaptation is absolutely awful), but this book is probably my second favorite. The way he uses pseudo-science to create thrillers seems unmatched. <br/><br/>This series is arguably his most successful. He takes our childhood fascination with dinosaurs to the next level. He also highlights the arrogance of men. You might think if given the chance, we'd be smarter than the characters in the book, but I'm not sure that'd be true. I fully believe if it were possible to recreate dinosaurs some greedy idiot would totally do it. There is part of me that'd want to visit the park too. Meanwhile the rest of my brain is screaming what a terrible idea it all is.<br/><br/>All and all, this book is a fun ride full of wonder, terror and a lot of stupidity. I'm glad I revisited the book.

I'd recommend people read it, but won't start advocating it as a must read.<br/><br/><b>Audiobook:</b> I did the unabridged audio book from Audible. This version had multiple readers. There was the main narrator, and a secondary narrator for all the various excerpts written by Princess Irulan.<br/><br/>They also had readers for most of the main characters. Some of the conversations were more like a radio program than a book with the readers conversing with each other as the characters would. <br/><br/>The confusing thing to me was sometimes the dialogue used the multiple readers, and sometimes it didn't and was simply read by the main narrator.

I got a free audiobook from Audible thanks to the <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword and Laser</a> podcast and I needed a book for my Christmas road trip, so this seemed like a good fit.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed all the plotting and politics involved in this book. There was also an interesting array of characters with different backgrounds and desires that often lead to confrontation. <br/><br/>This reminds me a lot of Star Trek DS9 or Babylon 5 which I wouldn't be surprised to find were inspired by Dune. Often times the science fiction takes a back seat to the conflict. It's more of a sci-fi setting than a sci-fi story. <br/><br/>It shows that even on another planet with strange creatures and technology that greed, honor, war, revenge and many other Human behaviors are really just the same no matter what the setting.<br/><br/>If I had any one gripe about the book it was lack of detail in the ending. Everything that has building comes to a head and seems to be over in short order. The ending itself wasn't a disappointment, but I felt like the execution was lacking.

It's been on my radar for awhile. I picked up the audiobook over 2 years ago, but never got to it for some reason. I wish I had been around for the group read as I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I found the start a bit slow. It could be bad timing though. I listened to the first quarter or so while traveling. I listened to parts of it standing in line for airport security hoping I wouldn't miss my flight. I listened to other parts wandering around Las Vegas for several hours waiting for my friends to arrive. It may not have had enough of my attention. It's really hard to say.<br/><br/>The other difference might be that instead of being a straight-forward novel, it's really a collection of stories. There is an overarching story of pilgrims on their way to a temple on a planet called Hyperion. However each person has their own backstory to share, and the style of each story tends to vary by quite a lot. I found some stories a lot more interesting than others. <br/><br/>I think my favorite would have to be the Poet's. I find that a bit strange because he was also the character I liked the least. A close second would be the scholar's. That was for entirely different reasons though. Overall I enjoyed all of the stories, but I found the priest's and soldier's the hardest to follow. I should probably go back and relisten as those were the parts I listened to while most distracted.<br/><br/>My only real gripe (if you can really call it that) is this book just sort of stops. I knew coming in it was part of a four book series, but this book could almost be called an extremely long prologue. Most of it is taken up by the backstories of all the characters. All that really means though is I'm jumping right into the next book. If I had to wait for that, I might actually be bothered by it.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this one a lot, and I'm looking forward to finishing the series over the next few months or so.",,,1,,Sword & Laser,1,2013/11/27,Audible,Like new,,

I think the last one would have been a lot better if he had simply told less story in it, and kept all the characters, but that's just me.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed that Bram only got a few chapters and his story barely moved at all. He seems to do this with Arya a lot as well, which makes her chapters all the better when they do come up. I was happy to find she had a few in this book near the end as well. In Bram's case however, I feel like nothing seems to happen.<br/><br/>Some of the Southern characters do make a return around the 70% mark, which was a bit sooner than I hoped/expected but given it's length compared to Feast, I suppose that's about right.<br/><br/>Overall despite a slow point where Mr. Martin chained together a string of chapters with all minor character POVs, I enjoyed this book a lot.<br/><br/>Now I'm stuck waiting like everyone else what will probably be another 5 years or so before seeing the next entry.

It was very tough to read. If I wasn't already invested in the story and the characters from the previous 3 books, I would never have finished.<br/><br/>Most authors I've read seem to grow in their writing ability and style as they go on. <br/><br/>Paolini doesn't appear to have grown at all. I'm not sure if being so successful at such a young age went to his head or if he never went on to get a formal education in writing techniques or what.<br/><br/>His dialogue is just painful in places. I'm not sure if he's trying to dumb things down to a younger reader level or if he just can't write proper dialogue between adults. The book touches on very adult problems of love and loss. Of war and redemption, but the dialogue feels childish in most places.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this book unless like me you want to see how it ends after already reading the previous books. I also wouldn't recommend this series as a whole to a new reader. There is a lot of better fantasy series out there that you should read instead.<br/><br/>Overall the series could have been much shorter. He goes off on tangents at several points in the 3rd and 4th books that don't seem to move the plot forward. This is often an issue with many fantasy books however. <br/><br/>I find it particularly frustrating here because despite all this extra pointless detail, he seems to leave a lot of things unanswered. I hope he doesn't plan to add a 5th book to the series, and that he simply wanted to leave some things to the reader's imagination. I feel like he could have explained a few things better while still accomplishing that however.<br/><br/>Read on if you want some more specific examples of problems with some light spoilers.<br/><br/><spoiler><br/>1. Roran is sent off to win some battle in place of another commander for a city that seems to have real point to the plot apart from growing Roran's reputation and to allow for him to be promoted to a Commander in the army.<br/><br/>2. There is an over abundance of Dues Ex Machina. In particular Angela showing up and solving huge problems at critical moments. Angela's character is never sufficiently explained as to who she is or how she is able to do what she does. She mostly seems to be a plot device Paolini to write himself out of the corners he puts himself in. Another example is some mystery woman who shows up at a critical moment to save Roran from certain death who presence/background is never touched on.<br/><br/>3. The complaint of Paolini's copying from popular works (LotR, Star Wars) is not a new one. I'd forgiven some/most of it as simply popular themes in fiction/fantasy (ie the poor young being thrust into a grand adventure with the mysterious mentor). But his ending is almost identical to the end of LotR. The battle against the great evil won, the heroes move on.<br/><br/></spoiler>",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

She really adds that extra something I hope to get from every audio book performance.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>This series is a lot of fun. My main complaint on my first read still holds true on the reread. I just don't care about the Vord. I enjoy the internal politics of the Alerans. I love the differences of the Alerans to the Marat, Canim and Ice Men. <br/><br/>The battles and interactions with those races seems far superior to the stuff with the Vord. The previous 5 books the Vord while important are more of a setting rather than a large player. A looming threat as it were. In this book unfortunately, they feature way too much for my liking. The scenes where the Vord Queen is talking just felt to go on too long.<br/><br/>That said, I ended up enjoying this book more on my reread than I did the first time. As I said, it's a lot of fun. If you're looking for something deep or complex you'll be disappointed. On the other hand if you want some great characters, a pretty cool magic system, and some really excellent action scenes you'll find plenty of that here.<br/><br/>While Tavi is clearly the main protagonist one could also argue that it's just as much Amara's story as well. It's her POV that opens the series and she plays almost as significant a role in the events of the series as Tavi himself. So it's no surprise that she plays an important role here. <br/><br/>In a genre overrun by male characters, it's a nice change of pace. I can't speak to the accuracy of her as a woman, but she's certainly not your stereotypical female character whose only job is to seduce or annoy the male characters. Some of her stories/scenes got a little slow for me in places, but when they were good I was just as excited to get back to her as I was for Tavi.<br/><br/>Overall I think this is a pretty good conclusion to a pretty good series that will probably always be overshadowed by Mr. Butcher's more popular Dresden Files. Most things are wrapped up pretty well, but I'd love to get a sequel book/series where we catch up to how things play out 20 or 50 years down the road.",,,2,,,1,,,unspecified,,

However I find myself changing my mind on this reread. Unlike that book all of the subplots in this book greatly interested me. <br/><br/>There was no slowdown in the middle and this might be the only book where anyone’s story was more interesting to me than Tavi’s. I think this series shines best when dealing with internal politics of the Alerans followed closely by the interactions with the Canim. <br/><br/>This series has large amounts of both. We learn a lot more about the Alerans, and see that people can be just as petty towards their fellow man under even the most dire of circumstances.<br/><br/>My least favorite parts have to do with the Vord, but in this book they are still mostly relegated to the setting. In other words they are a looming threat hanging over everything and impacting the interactions between the characters, while not really being on screen all that much.<br/><br/>Tavi still has to rely on his ingenuity more than his personal strength to overcome most obstacles which I think is what makes him such a likable character to me.

It still remains there after my reread. It just wasn't quite up to my current standards for 5 star reads, so unlike [b:The Eye of the World|228665|The Eye of the World (Wheel of Time, #1)|Robert Jordan|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1337818095s/228665.jpg|2008238], I couldn't justify keeping it at 5 stars.<br/><br/>For a book named The Dragon Reborn, there is very little of the Dragon himself. Instead it focuses on several of the characters that were more secondary in the first two books. Apart from Perrin, the others didn't get nearly so much page time as they do in this book.<br/><br/>My personal favorite, at least on this reread is Mat. I still found him kind of annoying and whiny at the start of the series, but in this book he finally starts down the path on his way to my favorite character. There are parts I'm just itching to get to again, but I'm enjoying the journey there a lot sooner than I did on my first read.<br/><br/>Perrin was my clear favorite for much of my first read, and I again enjoyed his sections here. However, some of the things that came to annoy me about him later in the series were more noticeable this time around.<br/><br/>Nynaeve is already displaying both some of her most obnoxious tendencies (tugging the braid), but I also found she's showing some of the characteristics that made me come to really like her by the end of the series too. I hope that continues with my reread, because I found her one of the worst parts of the middle books the first time through.<br/><br/>Overall the pace of this book is still pretty good compared to my recollection of later books, and there is a lot of great character development for the supporting cast, in particular Mat.<br/><br/>I'm still going strong for my reread and plan to jump into the 4th book at some point soon.

Mr. Butcher established the world and the key players in the last 2 books, and now he gets down the business of telling the story.<br/><br/><b>Audio book:</b> I didn't like Ms. Reading too much at the start. Her male voices bothered me. By this book however, I couldn't imagine anyone else reading this. There is a scene where random legionaries are calling out and Ms. Reading does different voices for all of them. <br/><br/>I think she's also flushed out the voices she uses for all the main and secondary characters to really add that extra something that not all audio books readers seem to manage.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I was both a bit eager and nervous for this re-read. This is only of only a handful of books that I've given 5 stars to and on my favorites shelf. My memory of it seems to have held up pretty well however.<br/><br/>This book seems feels far less trope heavy to me as the last two. You still have your chosen one story, but I was just so wrapped up in the awesomeness of it all that I just didn't spend any thinking about it.<br/><br/>The first half of this book is good, but the second half is even better. Unlike the last book where I somewhat dreaded any chapter that took us away from the main story, the secondary stories in this book are much more interesting. Adding a lot of depth to the politics of the world and many of the secondary characters.<br/><br/>For a book that focuses mostly on a newly formed legion, there seems to actually be less time spent on battles, which may be a plus or minus for you depending on how much you enjoy reading them. Personally I think he strikes the balance just right and Tavi really shines in this book as a result.<br/><br/>No one is going to accuse this of being some deep, complex series full of numerous unexpected twists and turns. However while some of it is pretty predictable, I think Mr. Butcher does manage a few surprises amid the more expected plot developments. But honestly, who cares? I was having far too much fun listening this book to spend much of the review getting into that.<br/><br/>Part adventure, part political thriller, part war novel with a decent amount of romance thrown in, there is a likely something for everyone here.

This book starts and ends really well, but slows down in the middle some. <br/><br/>Like the first two books, some of the subplots just move too slow and left me wanting to get back to Tavi's story. In particular Amara's story really dragged for me here. I felt the tedium of her journey a little too much for my liking.<br/><br/>The start of this book mostly picks up right where Cursor's Fury leaves off (albeit a few years have passed) with Tavi and the First Aleran fighting the Canim. <br/><br/>Mr. Butcher does war well, and I think of all the antagonists of the series, the Canim are by far my favorite. They remind me a bit of Klingons. They really fit the proud warrior trope merged with wolfpack mentality to create a fun and interesting race.<br/><br/>The politics are ramped up in this one along with the stakes. Alera is at war on two fronts, and something has to give. The senator and his ""bodyguards"" remind me of everything I hate about politicians, so Mr. Butcher did a good job on that front I think.<br/><br/>The dialogue and the humor are great once again. Mr. Butcher always writes an excellent climax and this one is no different.<br/><br/>While there is still a lot yet to resolve, this one ends in a nice place that allowed me to take a short break and read another book.",,,2,,,1,,,unspecified,,

Both do a great job. The hours just fly by.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>My original review talked about a slow start. I'm not really sure what I meant by that though. This book has one of the best prologues of the series. Dubbed the ""Darkfriend social"" by fans, we get a ton of foreshadowing and clues to events that don't unfold until later in the series. <br/><br/>Maybe I didn't appreciate it as much the first time as I did on this reread. There are a few slower parts in first half or so, mostly time spent traveling around, but those were never very long or all that slow for me.<br/><br/>I think the real highlight here is we start to broaden the POVs out away from Rand. I like him, and at the core it's really his story, but the reason I love this series is all the depth and subplots. <br/><br/>Nynaeve continues to get on my nerves a bit, but there is part of this book towards then end that reminded me of why she becomes one of my favorite characters later in the series. It's just a shame Mr. Jordan made her so frustrating for so long.<br/><br/>I'm a sucker for the magic school trope, and even though there isn't much of it here, I do like the glimpse we get into the novice program of the Aes Sedai. Egwene, Elayne and Nynaeve all appear to be way more powerful than everyone else, but don't really know what the heck they are doing.<br/><br/>We also get a bit more depth to Mat and Perrin foreshadowing some of their stories to come, that really make this series more than just Rand's tale.<br/><br/>Out in the world we get to meet some great new characters and catch up with some old ones. We learn about traveling stones and alternative universes a bit, adding even more depth to an already epic tale.<br/><br/>Then there are the Seanchan. Just their name makes me mad. The kind of things depicted here show that fantasy can be used to show the cruelty mankind is capable while still telling an entertaining story. <br/><br/>I know [a:George R.R.

I was worried that after reading hundreds of fantasy novels, and getting tired of the chosen one trope this book might not hold up to my memory of it. I was happy to find that I had nothing to worry about as I enjoyed it just as much on a reread as I did the first time.<br/><br/><b>Audiobook:</b> One of my main reasons for doing a reread was the chance to do the audio version.

I regret not spending more time talking to them, or at least getting a picture with them. <br/><br/>Most of this book is narrated by Mr. Kramer, as much of the book is told from Rand or Perrin's perspective. Ms. Reading only does the Nynaeve chapters, and there were very few of those. If I recall correctly from the later books, she'll be getting more to read later on in the series.<br/><br/>Both were excellent as expected.

I never had to deal with long waits between books, or deal with the uncertainty following Mr. Jordan's passing. A close friend had recommended me these books in college, but I just never got around to checking them out. I instantly fell in love.<br/><br/>The world Mr. Jordan has created feels huge and well lived in. The passing of ages leaving superstition, rumors and outright misinformation about what really happened. The reader only gets glimpses of the past, and mostly they come from stories. Magic is believed to be a thing of evil, and those who wield it to be feared.<br/><br/>Starting this book again was like catching up with old friends, only not quite as I remember them. My memories of them are how I left them after 13 long books, not the young and wide-eyed youths we meet here. <br/><br/>I forgot how annoying I found Mat in this book. He's incredibly far from my favorite character. Nynaeve wasn't nearly as annoying as she later becomes. I loved meeting Thom, Lan and Moiraine for the first time again. I also discovered there was a lot more foreshadowing in this book than I realized.<br/><br/>Part of my enjoyment could be the nostalgia I feel for this book and the series as a whole. Without it, I might never have discovered how much I love fantasy. I've always been a slow reader, but I was also a much less frequent reader too. It took me the better part of 3 years to read the whole series. <br/><br/>I really love these early books, and the later ones. The character development and world building as the series are fantastic.

Doing the audiobooks for this series aren't a must like Mr. Butcher's Dresden Files, but they certainly aren't a bad option in my opinion.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>Like the last book, this one started a little slow for me. It also leans heavily on tropes. We get a bit of the magical school trope here, though not a lot of it. For me that's a bad thing, because it's one of the reason I like Harry Potter so much.<br/><br/>Then again when your protagonist has no magical abilities to speak of, I guess it makes little sense to dwell on the magical training that takes place there. Instead most of the focus is on politics between not only the various Aleran factions, but also with the Canim, a fierce wolf-like race who despite being considered enemies of the Alerans, maintain an embassy in the capital. This leads to one of my favorite characters of the series, Ambassador Varg.<br/><br/>This book also introduces my other favorite in Antillar Maximus. His antics remind me a bit of Harry Dresden and add some levity that was mostly lacking from the first novel.<br/><br/>Now what magical school story would be complete without the asshole bully, that I like to call ""The Malfoy""? (I know Harry Potter wasn't the first to use this trope, but its arguably the most popular). Tavi must deal with bullying on a more severe scale than he ever faced back home in the form of Kalarus Brencis Minoris, son of High Lord Kalarus and his two cronies. Is it a requirement the bully have exactly 2 cronies? It certainly seems like it.<br/><br/>The stereotypical bully isn't the only thing of concern here however, and there are once again shades of gray when it comes to just who is ""good"" and who is ""bad"", all rolled up into the politics between nobles that are the most powerful in more than just title. Seriously, you do not want to be trapped in a dark alley with a High Lord or Lady whose pissed at you. It won't end well.<br/><br/>The story is also split with events back in the Calderon valley. I found that subplot a bit slow/uninteresting on this re-read, although Doroga helps to make it worthwhile and the second half of that story is a lot more enjoyable than the first.<br/><br/>Overall I found there is a lot I like here, in particular the politics and some of the new characters, that help me get over some of the slower parts of the story.<br/><br/>On to book 3, which is one of my all-time favorites!",,,2,,,1,,,unspecified,,

However, she may not be well suited for this book as it has many male characters (then again what fantasy series doesn't?) and her male voices aren't as good. They aren't bad though, and eventually I got used to her so I wasn't thinking about the fact that it was a woman attempting a man's voice even though it was always apparent.<br/><br/>I think her theater background is apparent with the variety of inflections and voices she uses as well as the emotion and inflection of her reading.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>Until maybe 2 years ago I didn't really read that much anymore. I wasn't well-read in fantasy. In late 2006 I discovered [a:Jim Butcher|10746|Jim Butcher|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1205261964p2/10746.jpg] and the Dresden Files. I devoured all the books that were out until I was stuck waiting like everyone else. <br/><br/>Then I noticed in the back of the books that Mr. Butcher had 3 books in another series though, called Codex Alera. Unlike the Dresden Files, it wasn't Urban Fantasy, but closer to ""traditional"" or epic fantasy. I picked it up and devoured those books as well.<br/><br/>For awhile I liked this series better than Dresden Files, but it was a close thing. One thing was for certain, [a:Jim Butcher|10746|Jim Butcher|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1205261964p2/10746.jpg] wrote the kind of books I liked to read. For 3 glorious years I had 2 new Butcher books/year to look forward to.<br/><br/>Fast forward 7 years or so and I recently did a re-read of Dresden Files in audio, but haven't read this one since it ended back in 2009. I'd consider myself much better read in Fantasy than when I first discovered this. <br/><br/>I was a bit apprehensive about a reread. Would the series live up to my memory of it? Or would I find all the tropes tired and boring? The answer is a little of both it seems.<br/><br/>It took me a bit to get back into this book. I was starting to get nervous that I was ruining my memory of this series. However once things really got going, I remembered why I enjoyed it so much.<br/><br/>This is a ""chosen one"" story through and through. However most chosen one stories tend to have a protagonist who is suddenly great at everything. This one does not. In a world where everyone posses at least a little magic, Tavi has none. He is considered a ""freak"". That notion of being an outsider is something I've always identified with. I liked that Tavi had to use his wits to make it in a world where he was always at a disadvantage. That said, a 15 year old shepherd boy who saves the realm has been done. A lot.<br/><br/>The book also has some ""mustache-twirling"" bad guys. Mr. Butcher does a good job at making me hate those characters, but at the same time they feel a bit cartoonish. That said, there are other antagonists in the series who are much more complex. They aren't evil necessarily, but are willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish their goals. Those goals happen to be set against our young protagonist and his family, so they come out looking evil. But are they really? That's an ongoing question that won't be answered here.<br/><br/>I didn't know it until many years later, but Mr. Butcher was challenged to write a story based on a ""lame idea"". He countered that he could it using 2 Lame ideas, that of ""Lost Roman Legion"" and Pokemon. It sounds really stupid, but it somehow works for me.<br/><br/>I know almost nothing of Pokemon apart from the whole capturing magical creatures thing. There may be more to it. I don't know. The strongest furycrafters in the book have the ability to summon powerful elementals ala Pokemon, but they aren't the only part of it. His magic system is really fun and creative, though you really don't get the full experience in just this book. To this day though, it's one of the magic systems I've most enjoyed reading.<br/><br/>So if you can get past the heavy trope use and magic system based on Pokemon, the only other thing that may turn people away is battles. This series is battle heavy. I'd guess most of the last 25% of this book or so is one long battle. I loved it. People that aren't into that kind of thing, may find it tedious.<br/><br/>I think the story is pretty well self-contained. There are a lot of bigger questions looming, but all issues of the book are wrapped up pretty nicely in my opinion.<br/><br/>I had originally planned on alternating the books in this series with books from another, but by the time I got to that battle, there was just no way I could stop. I jumped right into the next book, and may continue on all the way to the end without a break.",,,2,,,1,,,unspecified,,

Nothing happened. For like 8 hours of audio. A sign of things to come. 3.5 stars rounded up for the much stronger 80%.<br/><br/><b>Audiobook:</b> Another fantastic audio book by Micheal Kramer and Kate Reading. I doubt I could have gotten through the first 20% again if not for doing it in audio.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>My original review from my first read complained about a slow start. It was vastly understating that. My recollection had been this series didn't get slow until the the middle books. I think most of the first 20% could have been thrown away, or trimmed down to just a few chapters.<br/><br/>Once I got past it though, things picked up dramatically. A lot of this book focuses on Perrin. I found him and Faile super annoying in that first 20%, but much better as the story went on. His arc was really good. Eventually. Sensing a theme? I can remember now why he was my favorite of the series for so long though.<br/><br/>My favorite parts on this reread was Mat. I had been waiting for some of these events to happen, thinking they occurred in books 2 or 3. They were even better to experience on a reread because I know what a lot of the cryptic foreshadowing really means. I think I like Mat a lot earlier on in the series than I did originally. He only gets better as the series progresses too.<br/><br/>I was surprised to find myself enjoying Nynaeve so much in this book. I recall finding her very annoying until quite late in the series. However we get a lot of the stuff that I come to love about her later in this book. It's too bad Mr. Jordan had to make her so irritating for so long.<br/><br/>Egywene's story is pretty interesting too, but the best part are the wise ones. For as bad as Mr. Jordan seems to make the Aes Sedai, the Wise Ones are great. I think the Aiel women in general often save this series from itself in terms of the female characters.<br/><br/>Finally of course there is Rand himself. He's got more of a role in this book than the last one, but he still kind of takes a back seat to some of the other characters. I don't feel like we get a good sense about what he's feeling/planning. We're just as in the dark as everyone else.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this book, but that first 20% is really a sign of things to come, and why I went from telling everyone and their brother to read this series, to struggling to get through the middle to when things finally get good again.<br/><br/>I still really like this series, but feel like it could have used a better editing sometimes. I'm looking forward to continuing my audio reread, but I'm dreading some of those slow parts to come.",,,2,,,0,,,,,
