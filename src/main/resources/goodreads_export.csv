There were elements here I liked, but not enough ever really get into the story. I considered giving this a 2.5 and rounding up, but opted to just stick to 2.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>Of all the science fiction tropes, time travel has always been one of my favorite. Back to the Future, Doctor Who, Looper, Primer, Terminator among others. You'll notice though that all of those are movies/TV and not books. I tend to enjoy Sci-Fi far more in video form than I do in the written word. I especially don't have the best track record with older works.<br/><br/>I was unfamiliar with Ms. Norton, which probably shouldn't be a surprise. She seems a decent enough writer, but I just never got sucked into this particular story. I read the revised edition of this book. I have no idea how much was revised, but the story itself didn't feel that dated. I grew up during the tail end of the cold war, so I get the context well enough. <br/><br/>Instead of the space race it's now focused on time travel. I'm a little unclear as to why however. There is a brief mention that space travel lost its appeal shortly after the moon landing. But why time travel? Both sides are afraid to change the past, so what do they hope to gain? Maybe that is made clear in later books, as this is the start of a series.<br/><br/>I didn't particularly like Ross Murdock either. I'm not sure how popular the anti-hero was back when this was written, but I've read plenty of anti-hero stories and this one just never pulled off the likable scoundrel that the best ones seem to.<br/><br/>Overall this was a quick read, with some interesting ideas that just seemed to fall flat for me. I'm glad to have given it a shot, and I'm not ruling out trying another story by Ms. Norton in the future, but I'm not rushing out for it, and likely won't read the second story that came with the first one.",,,1,,,1,2016/06/20,Amazon,unspecified,,

Either way, I was disappointed enough in that book, that I was reluctant to pick this one up. I had planned to wait on reviews from people I trusted to come out before getting it. Then a review copy fell into my lap.<br/><br/>This book is kind of a hodge podge of several things I love: Mistborn, Indiana Jones, James Bond, and Dragons. And if that's not enough there is also high sea adventure, and pirates! That may sound like a mess, but Mr. Ryan does a great job in blending those elements together. I also can't guarantee all of those things were influences on this book, but they are things I thought about as I was reading.<br/><br/>Mistborn has one of my all time favorite magic systems. This one feels similar, only a little less structured, and with only 4 known types of abilities. The main similarity is the idea of imbibing something in order to do magic, and that only a small number of people are born with the ability. Beyond that they are quite different.<br/><br/>My favorite character is Lizanne, who is basically Jane Bond. Her story line was always my favorite, and I really want to know more about the training she went through. I hope we get some flashbacks or possibly her training new recruits in future books, but then I'm a sucker for the magic school trope.<br/><br/>Clay was also a great character, and a more reluctant protagonist then Lizanne. His story was reminiscent of an Indiana Jones story, with him being basically nothing like him. If anyone is Jones it's maybe his uncle.<br/><br/>The final protagonist, Lt. Hilemore was enjoyable enough, but I spent much of the book wondering how his story fit in with the other two. Rest assured it's made clear by the end of the story, but it takes awhile. That doesn't mean his story wasn't interesting, it just felt disconnected from the rest of the book for me. With him you get high seas battles and pirates!<br/><br/>None of that even scratches the surface of the great supporting cast. Each subplot has it's own supply of interesting characters. And if 3 interesting protagonists influenced by different elements, and a great supporting cast isn't enough. There are Dragons. And really, isn't that enough?<br/><br/>Overall, I'm glad I got this is a review copy because I really enjoyed this book. I just hope he can take his time on the sequels because I felt like his last book suffered from rushing to completion to meet a deadline. I love getting new books in a series once a year, but I'm willing to wait longer if the author needs more time. I'm hoping he'll be able to bring this to a more satisfying conclusion than his previous series.",,,1,,,1,2016/06/15,Review Copy,Like new,,

He was a good fit for this book making the audio a good option for this book.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>Apparently the real life ""Carlos the Jackal"" was given his nickname because this book was spotted on him. I'm not sure if that's true, but I had thought this was somehow related to him.<br/><br/>Instead it's a historical fiction/thriller about a real life group of French dissidents from the 1960s who hire a (fictitious) mercenary assassin to assassinate then French president Charles de Gaulle.<br/><br/>The book starts with a bit of a history lesson that I found a bit dry. It then goes into a lot of background about the dissident group (called the O.A.S) and France in the 1960s. Charles de Gaulle survived six assassination attempts, which is pretty crazy. I can see why Mr. Forsyth chose him/France as his backdrop. I probably wouldn't have appreciated the politics without all the background, but I still found it on the slow side.<br/><br/>In general, I found some parts of the book far too detailed for my liking. I'm not a huge crime buff. I tend to prefer my thrillers to be a bit more action oriented than this was. I think anyone who enjoys that kind of thing will find this story more enjoyable than I did.<br/><br/>The final third of the book where the plan of the Jackal was being executed while a massive man hunt to find and stop him was underway was a lot more enjoyable to me than all the setup and planning parts that take up the first two-thirds.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this was a decent read, but wasn't quite as exciting as I had expected.",,,1,,,1,2016/06/05,Audible,Like new,,

I wasn't really interested though. It sounded Young Adult, which I don't tend to enjoy, and I'm already not a big ""Steampunk"" fan. I'm not sure what qualifies as steam punk exactly, but maybe that's an inaccurate description? I'll leave that someone else. It's certainly closer to steam punk than it is to traditional fantasy. <br/><br/>I only picked it up because it was the June pick for Sword & Laser. This was a borrow over buy, and I still think that was the correct decision. It took me well over halfway to start getting into it. I wasn't particularly excited by any of the characters. <br/><br/>The main character irritated me for much of the book. The only thing that helped her case was many of the characters she interacted with were worse. The main exception was probably the twins, whose names I forget at this point.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of the ""magic school"" trope, and this book had a bit of that vibe, right down to the asshole rival. However it was really the world building and the mystery of it that I found the most interesting. I wish we had been told a lot more than we were. Why do they live in the sky? Is there still a surface left? Where do the bones they use to build things come from?<br/><br/>More than anything else, finding out more about the world is what has me interested in reading the next book.

I think it varies with each book somewhat. At it's core though, it's a book that makes me feel something.

Do they make me laugh or cry? This one did all of those things in the same book. To me that's a sure sign of a great book. Everyone has their own metrics. I just loved this book. I wasn't planning on finishing it today, but it had other plans. I made time to finish it.<br/><br/>Finally after two slow starts, this book gets it right.

Darrow grew on me in the last book, but it was Sevro, Mustang and Pax that made that happen. I've rarely despised a character as much as the Jackel.

You get great inflections and accents adding a lot to the story. It really helped me get through the first third of this book when I was otherwise bored. Audio is the only way to go for this book/series in my opinion.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>This book/series has been getting a ton of buzz. I really didn't care. I don't much care for YA books it seems, and the whole dystopian uprising story has been done to death. The main reason I picked it up was that it was on sale and I really like the narrator.<br/><br/>For the first 33% or so, I felt like my original reluctance was totally justified. I was bored. It felt like paint by numbers. Nothing surprising or interesting happened. At its core there really isn't anything new here. It combines elements of several well known/successful fantasy series, but puts them in a science fiction setting.<br/><br/>Yet despite that, once the real story got started, and all the setup was finally done, I got sucked in. I like the characters, I like the world building, and despite it's rather bleak/dystopian overtones, I found it a lot of fun somehow. It's a bit of a school trope (which I'm totally a sucker for), though it's more [b:Battle Royale|57891|Battle Royale|Koushun Takami|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1331235272s/57891.jpg|2786327] than Harry Potter. <br/><br/>I'm sure many people would say [b:The Hunger Games|2767052|The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1)|Suzanne Collins|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1447303603s/2767052.jpg|2792775] instead, since that's the more recent/better know story. While I enjoyed that story, I just couldn't take the writing and preferred the movies to the books. The writing here could have used some more polish, especially in the first part, but I found it infinitely more readable.<br/><br/>I might file this book under ""guilty pleasure"" reading, except I don't feel guilty. I like reading a book that makes me want to cheer out loud. I like having a character to root for against insurmountable odds. I love to hate when the author makes me angry or sad at a character's mistakes or misfortune. This book had all of that.<br/><br/>It also had an original enough story that caused me to mostly forget about its slow start and sucked me in. I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. For the start of a trilogy, it does end in a decent place. There are plenty of questions left, but I feel like you could pause to read something else. Thankfully however, I don't have to and I immediately jumped into [b:Golden Son|18966819|Golden Son (Red Rising, #2)|Pierce Brown|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1394684475s/18966819.jpg|26984955].<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to seeing where things go with this series, and if he can keep up the story from the latter two thirds of this book, I suspect I'll enjoy the rest of the ride, even if it ends in seemingly inevitable tragedy.",,,1,,,1,2016/04/23,Audible,Like new,,

It's probably considered hard sci-fi, but I'd put it somewhere between that and space opera. You get into the science a bit at times, but mostly it's about the issues facing a generation ship, and attempting to colonize an alien environment.<br/><br/>There were parts of the story I really enjoyed. I liked Freya acting as our camera as she explored the ship and the different cultures that lived there. I also really liked the middle parts dealing with the colonization stuff, and exploring a new world.<br/><br/>However, things kind of slowed down for me at times throughout, but especially towards the end. I've seen people say this book could have been ended at an earlier point, and get what they mean. I'm not sure if that would have better, or if there had simply been less time spent on the final arc of the book.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked this book and I'm glad I read it. I'll consider picking up another book by Mr. Robinson at some point, but I'm not in a rush to do so. I'd really like to read another book about a generation ship, but one that is more focused on that idea and ideally more space opera than hard sci-fi.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

In fact there was only one other scene where I wasn't completely sucked into this book.<br/><br/>Not only do we get the excellent characters, and RPG in-jokes from the first, but there is a really cool overarching plot developing. So when do we get the third book? Is it now? I'd like it now.

I'm sure it's not a new idea, but I had never encountered a mage's guild with magic doors in various cities, but I totally love that idea, and wish my now bored/retired Wizard had been able to join.<br/><br/>My favorite addition is probably the traveling saleswoman though. Sadly between the audio and my general terrible memory (especially for names), I couldn't tell you her name. She makes a great addition to the already excellent cast of characters of this series.<br/><br/>Two books in, this series is a ton of fun. I have no idea how many more books Mr. Hayes has planned, but I'm eagerly hoping to get another one soon. In the meantime I'll continue to use whatever limited influence I have on goodreads to get more people to check out this series. If you're an RPG fan, I especially recommend this.<br/><br/>Grab your dice and roll along with the NPCs and the players as they take on many well-worn tropes in fun and often humorous fashion.",,,1,,,1,2016/03/28,Audible,Like new,,

There was a big debate about if this book is YA or not. Personally I don't think it matters very much. To me it's about whether I connect with a book, and not how it's marketed.<br/><br/>This books started out pretty strong for me. We're introduced to Kell and his awesome fashion accessory, and the idea of ""parallel"" Londons, where he is one of a very few who can travel between them. Soon after we meet a thief in one of the Londons named Lila. <br/><br/>Both have interesting premises, but I had a hard time connecting with them(or any character for that matter). I found most of the early part of the book slow and relatively uneventful. I wasn't bored, but it felt as though very little happened at times. While I tend to prefer character-driven stories like this, it requires caring for the characters more than I did here.<br/><br/>The world building is interesting, but I found the description misleading. To me the concept of ""alternate"" Londons made me think they would share more in common with each other than a name. They are vastly different. It didn't feel like alternate versions of the same city at all. Still, I found the idea of world hopping magic appealing, and the history of how each developed varied enough.<br/><br/>The magic ""system"" is almost non-exist. I tend to prefer well-defined magic systems, and this feels underdeveloped. Considering the Antari are so rare, I'd have been interesting in exploring this aspect more than it was. Hopefully that will come in the later books.<br/><br/>Once the story got going near the middle I was a lot more interested. However I felt like after taking too long to start, the ending was rushed.

I tore through it in only a few days (fast for me) and I'm still not sure how I feel about it. 3.25 Stars. Maybe 3.5?<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I was familiar with Charlie Jane Anders from i09. I knew she had a book coming out this year, but I wasn't really planning to read it. I can't say why, probably because I already have so many other books I want to read.<br/><br/>I was interested to see how this book would turn out. The answer for me was largely depressing. I spent a few years reading dark fantasy, before burning out on it. This isn't really in the same category, but it's definitely not what I'd consider a fun book.<br/><br/>This seems to be a tale of two halves. I seem to have a few friends who like me found the first half of this book incredibly difficult to read through, and not very enjoyable, but found the second half better. Then there are others who seemed to love the first half and not the second. It goes to show you how books often speak differently to people.<br/><br/>Laurence and Patricia were interesting characters, but hard to like at times. I was sympathetic to their horrible upbringing, but their actions often left me confused. They often seemed to make matters worse. Maybe it's because while I had my issues growing up, it was nothing like Ms. Anders subjects them too. I really feel bad for anyone who has a childhood remotely like theirs, and consider myself lucky that I didn't.<br/><br/>Normally a book I read this fast would be an easy 5 star rating for me, but I found myself so conflicted for much of the story. I very much liked the idea of mixing magic and engineering. That's right in my wheelhouse. I would categorize this book as pure fantasy in a modern (or near future) setting though. The engineer may be based on sound principles (I can't speak to that myself), but you won't get much explanation about what Laurence and his friends are doing. I think that's for the best though. There is enough going on here without mixing hard sci-fi in too.<br/><br/>I liked this book. I didn't love it. I really don't enjoy depressing stories, and I found this far more depressing than something like [b:The Magicians|6101718|The Magicians (The Magicians, #1)|Lev Grossman|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1313772941s/6101718.jpg|6278977], which is pretty up there too. I think if the first part of the story had been a lot less cringe inducing for me it would have been a solid 4 for me.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the ending, though it felt a bit rushed. I would have liked more time spent on the ""big reveal"" rather than just the final few chapters. I saw part of it coming, but I think the ending might have been stronger if it was revealed a bit earlier on.<br/><br/>Overall I think this is one of those books where people may enjoy one half more than the other. If like me you don't enjoy the first part, you might enjoy the second half better. I'm glad this was chosen for the March <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword & Laser</a> because I probably wouldn't have read it otherwise. I will definitely pay more attention if Ms. Anders releases another book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Scott Brick does his usual quality job. Whenever you see Mr. Brick's name on an audiobook, you know you're going to get a good reading. <br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I came into this book thinking it was a reread. I did a handful of books by Mr. Crichton when I was in high school, and I thought this was among them. As I got further into the book, I became convinced otherwise.<br/><br/>I found the beginning very interesting. A psychologist is brought in to  help with a crash that turns out to be a spaceship on the bottom of the ocean. I liked the mystery and investigation aspect of the story, more than the viewpoint of the main character itself though.<br/><br/>As the plot develops and we learn more about not only the ship, but the sphere it contains, I found my mind starting to wander. I didn't get attached to any of the characters. I found myself annoyed by most of the scientists. Several of them seemed to be more concerned about being published and/or their place in history than the actual investigation itself. I've always been more of an engineer than a scientist, but I don't know why anyone would want to deal with that.<br/><br/>As with the other Michael Crichton books I've read, this one takes science and posits some plausible seeming possibilities. He always seemed to have a knack for the techno-thriller in a way that doesn't feel cheesy and over the top.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I was disappointed with the truth of the Sphere, or if my detatchment from the characters just got to me, but by about the 50% mark, I found my mind starting to wander a bit. The ending was pretty strong though, and probably saved it from me rounding down to a three.<br/><br/>I've been wanting to take a break from SFF this year, and while this is definitely still in the Sci-Fi wheelhouse, it's more of a thriller with a sci-fi premise than a pure science fiction book. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as [b:Timeline|7669|Timeline|Michael Crichton|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1405420745s/7669.jpg|1525987] or [b:Jurassic Park|6424171|Jurassic Park|Michael Crichton|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1344371661s/6424171.jpg|3376836], but I'm glad I finally read it.",,,1,,,1,2016/01/31,Review Copy,Like new,,

He spoke clearly and with good inflections. He also did some decent accents for the characters of the book. If you're going to read this book (something I'm a bit iffy on), audio is a good option.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>The description of this book was a bit misleading to me. I saw ""<i>young army lieutenant Lucas Athan recovers a sarcophagus excavated from an Egyptian tomb</i>"" and I'm thinking ancient Egypt, pyramids, mummies, etc.<br/><br/>There is none of that. Instead the sarcophagus is thought to belong to a Christian saint. Wait What? And if that's not strange enough, half this book follows Einstein around. Much of his parts felt completely unnecessary to the plot. <br/><br/>I'm not saying he's an unimportant figure in the story. His name's in the title after all. I just don't really get why so much time was spent on his daily life. If anything this book makes me want to pick up a biography on Einstein. It's the second fictionalized version of him I've read. The other was in [b:Cryptonomicon|816|Cryptonomicon|Neal Stephenson|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1327931476s/816.jpg|1166797], which I found far more enjoyable.<br/><br/>The plot and the characters apart from Einstein (and other fictionalized versions of historical characters) were largely unmemorable. The story was pretty standard thriller, but at a much slower pace than I generally find for good thrillers.<br/><br/>It's not a bad book, It's just not a great book either.

I just found the story moving far too slow. Maybe it is the format's problem. If I wasn't liking one story, it wouldn't be too long before a new one started that I might enjoy better.

The mystery of Hyperion and the Shrike. The politics of the Web worlds and the Ousters. Battles and intrigue. And the well written prose.

Now that's not unusual for me but I used to read a lot more mysteries and thrillers and didn't really get too heavy into fantasy until college.<br/><br/>I solicited some recommendations for non-SFF books to check out with the main criteria being light and fun. Apparently I picked the most ridiculous book to start with first. For me the main attraction was the Indiana Jones vibe/the mentions of Ancient Egypt. I loved Ancient Egypt as a kid. One of the main reasons I got in Stargate was its basis in Ancient Egypt.<br/><br/>This book is fun, don't get me wrong. However the writing was pretty bad. I also had believability issues. Not only in the ""military"" actions of some of the characters, but the politics. I get America is not everyone's favorite country. It's totally understandable. Still I have a really hard time believing that Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Ireland (not the UK) will team up with Spain and the United Arab Emirates against the US. First off that seems a bit random. Second it shows a lack of understanding on the author's part about the nature of the relationship between the major English speaking nations.<br/><br/>Even that aside, I have a really hard time believing any nation, will just casually use soldiers as expendable test subjects for ancient traps. It just seemed silly. It wasn't just the Americans either. There was also the evil Europeans made up of France, Germany and the Vatican. What!? I know this is fiction, but seriously..did this guy not learn any world history growing up? I feel like he made his factions by using darts on a map or something.<br/><br/>Anyways in addition to the bad writing/unbelievable parts, most of the characters felt paper-thin and cartoonish. By the end I just wanted to be done. It's probably why after long thought I'm rounding my rating down.<br/><br/>That said, I did enjoy good chunks of this book. I liked the general premise of the plot, the exploration of ancient tombs/wonders and the various traps they encountered and had to overcome. I bet a better author could have made a really good story out of it.<br/><br/>It's too bad because I had pretty high hopes for this one, and since it's book 1 in a series, I figured I'd have a few to read. I just can't though. This author just apparently isn't for me. Still I'm glad I read the book. It's definitely the type of book I was looking to read.

I haven't liked Harlequin since meeting him in the first book. However, thanks to getting inside his head, a series of flashbacks, and character growth, I found him much more likeable this time around. We get a lot more world building in this one, at least in terms of how the state of the first book came to be. We don't learn everything though. Magic continues to be total hand-waving and largely unexplained. While that kind of thing tends to bother me in general, there really wasn't room for it here.<br/><br/>The main plot of this one was pretty good, but this book suffered a bit from pacing issues. I felt like some of the early parts dragged a bit, while the ending felt a bit rushed.<br/><br/>A lot of the world building was done through flashbacks. I enjoyed them overall, but I tired of them a bit by the end. It might have been a bit better with one or two fewer if he had simply cut out some extra details to the main plot.<br/><br/>By the end of the book, I was wondering if he'd be able to wrap things up well or not. I feel like he brought things to a good conclusion, but it could have used more detail. All the pieces sort of fell into place at the last moment.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the book and the series though, and I'll definitely be checking out the prequel series at some point.",,,1,,,1,2015/12/26,Audible,Like new,,

Or what they get up to when you're not around to rob, maim or pump them for information? Drew Hayes did, and it's pretty amusing. This book is full of in-jokes, both about RPG games (particularly the dice-rolling variety) and their players.<br/><br/>I had this on my radar for some time, but it took an audible sale and a friend reading/enjoying this book to finally get me to give it a shot. I shouldn't have waited. This book does for RPGs much like [b:Off to Be the Wizard|18616975|Off to Be the Wizard (Magic 2.0, #1)|Scott  Meyer|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1390179189s/18616975.jpg|24775619] does for general fantasy/video games. It's both funny and smart.<br/><br/>The characters are excellent too. You'll never look at Goblins the same way again. Mr. Hayes takes some well worn tropes of RPGs and comes at them from every angle, all while telling a pretty good story that will make you want to run out and pick up your dice. Or at least it did for me.<br/><br/>For you D&D sorts you may want to keep your copy of the player's handbook at hand, so you can look up various spells as you read. Or maybe that's just me. Perhaps you have them all memorized anyways.<br/><br/>The writing is a bit unpolished in some places, but I was too busy having fun to really care. Great characters, story telling and my general nostalgia of the years I spent playing Dungeons and Dragons really endeared this book to me immediately.<br/><br/>Mr. Hayes also sets things up nicely for a series. I'm not sure how many he has in mind, but I could read a whole bunch of them. I'm not playing D&D anymore, so this might be as close as I can get for now.<br/><br/>This book has far too few reviews on Goodreads. I highly recommend picking this up, at least if you're an RPG fan. I'll be curious to see if it's as enjoyable to general fantasy fans.

You could tell it was Mr. Cole's first novel. It felt clunky in places. I also didn't like Oscar Britton very much. That last point might have been intentional by the author though.<br/><br/>I was glad to discover that while this book continues the story of the first, it's largely told from a new viewpoint: Colonel Alan Bookbinder. He's VASTLY more likeable to me. That made a huge difference. It's hard for me to root for a character I don't like and it's hard for me to root against the protagonist.<br/><br/>In addition both the writing and the plot seemed more polished. Many of the events of the first book were in shades of grey. I never knew what I was rooting for half the time. I like that sort of story in general, but the execution frustrated me at times.<br/><br/>This one felt a lot more black and white. There was plenty of conflict Bookbinder had to deal with without him needing to be an asshole about everything. I think if Oscar Britton was more sympathetic to me, it might have worked better. In addition, Bookbinder is a character I can identify with better. While he is a military officer, he's an office worker and an administrator instead of coming from a combat background.<br/><br/>The pace of this book was good. The world building is fairly light though. You get more character development and personal history than you do of an explanation for magic, the source or how the world reached the point it was at.<br/><br/>For a middle book, I found this very enjoyable. Since I'm writing this review after having finished the next one, I can say that it's my favorite of the trilogy. That's pretty rare for me. In fact I can't recall another time where I enjoyed the middle book the most. It does suffer a bit from ""middle book syndrome"" though. It feels a bit transitional at times.<br/><br/>That said, I really enjoyed Bookbinder and his journey from normal office worker to major player in the world of militarized magic.

I read very little YA, and try to avoid Romance books in general. However, every review I saw about this one was positive. I got caught up in the Star Wars hype with Force Awakens coming out and decided to give it a go anyways.<br/><br/>The general premise of two friends growing up during the events of the original trilogy on opposite sides was appealing. Many of those elements of this book worked really well for me too. I liked the sort of ""boots on the ground"" view of events. <br/><br/>I thought the book was well written. It's always hard to write in someone else's world, especially Star Wars. This one was even harder because the overarching plot was already written and well-known by most if not all the people likely to pick the book up. Ms. Gray does a good job of working her story around notable events of the original trilogy while making it about her characters and not the better known ones. Plus, without getting into spoilers, there were some nice tie-ins to Force Awakens as well.<br/><br/>There are parts of this book I really enjoyed. I liked a pro-empire viewpoint. It offers a nice contrast to what your normally get. The idea that everyone in the empire is evil always seemed too black and white. I really liked the imperial flight school. I wish more time had been spent on the training and classes than the relationship of the protagonists though.<br/><br/>That was my main issue with the book. I just didn't care about the Romance part. I'm the wrong person to ask if it was well done. It's just not my thing. However, I can understand why this book is so popular. I think it's a good thing that Disney/authors are trying to tell new/different kinds of Star Wars stories that might appeal to different audiences.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this was a decent story whose execution didn't work as well for me as it seems to for others.

I think my favorite part of this series is how Kamala gets so excited when meeting and teaming up with other Superheroes.<br/><br/>Spider-Man was my favorite comic growing up, but two decades away from the comics and several bad movies later and I don't have the affection I once did.

I snagged this because of a sale after enjoying the movie, because the book is almost always better than the movie. This however, was a rare case when it wasn't.<br/><br/>I suspect that won't be true for everyone. I like history, but it's not a subject I read about much. I tend to prefer documentaries or dramatizations instead. The story in this book, about an elaborate plan to build not one but three tunnels to escape a German camp during World War Two sounds so incredible that it just screams movie plot.<br/><br/>I found the early going with a lot of the background information rather dry and slow. I imagine history buffs will find that more interesting than I did. I tend to forget names just as soon as I learn them however. Once the meat of the plan got going, I found it quite a fascinating read.<br/><br/>It's by no means a long book. Running around 7.5 hours. The movie is nearly 3. For me personally, I think the movie did a better job in showing the best parts, and cutting out some of the less interesting ones. Your mileage may vary. Either way I'm glad I read the story, but I'd probably recommend renting the movie instead.<br/>",,,1,,,1,2015/11/22,Audible,Like new,,

He covers mostly consoles for much of the book, and then circles back to talk about Gameboy later in the book.<br/><br/>In my 20's I abandoned Nintendo as they seemed to be stuck in the past, and I wanted new games and better variety. After buying every system from NES to Gamecube, I was now an XBox person.<br/><br/>Now in my 30s, I find myself wanting to play Mario, Link and Donkey Kong again. I've been awfully tempted to buy a Wii U over the Xbox One. <br/><br/>Personally, I still feel like Nintendo would do better going the route of Sega by putting their IPs on as many platforms as possible and leaving the hardware business behind. Shows what I know though. This book talks about how the Wii absolutely crushed the Xbox 360 and PS3 for many months. Nintendo seems content in letting Microsoft and Sony to fight over the hardcore adult gamers and focus on kids, casual fans, and the Mario/Link/etc diehards.<br/><br/>If you're like me and grew up on the NES/SNES and want to revisit your childhood gaming, this seems like a good book to do it with.",,,1,Fans of Nintendo in the 80s & 90s,,1,2015/11/19,Audible,Like new,,

If not for <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword & Laser</a> I probably never would have read this.<br/><br/>This is one of those books that read at a different point, I might have been bored by. I’ve been a bit burnt out on reading lately and this seemed to hit the spot. This is the classic chosen one trope mixed with the magic school trope. I’m a complete sucker for the Magic school trope. <br/><br/>It was obvious at times that this was Ms. Lackey’s first book. The writing was decent, but could use some more polish.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise for me were all the social issues casually woven into the story, especially given the time this was published. It seems like only recently that books are dealing with things like gender equality, homosexuality or casual sex without negative connotations are more commonplace. This book covers all of those things, but in subtle ways. It could simply be that my own personal reading selection in the 80s and 90s simply neglected other works covering these kinds of things. <br/><br/>This certainly seems to be a book aimed at young women more than boys. Much of my reading was stuff my mom brought home for me. I doubt the cover with the girl on the magic horse was something I’d have been willing to give a try in my teens. That said, who wouldn’t want a magic horse as your companion? If you don’t, you might be dead inside!<br/><br/>If this book was published today, it’d be put in the YA section and might be lost in vast array of fantasy aimed at young girls. In many ways this book feels like it could be a prototype for those books. However, as I don’t read a lot of YA anymore I could be wrong there.<br/><br/>The book ends in a pretty good place. The major issues seem to be wrapped up (albeit a bit too quickly and neatly). I feel like I might be up for reading more, but could be perfectly content to stop here.<br/><br/>Overall, I’m glad I read this book. I’m not sure if I’m going to continue on with the series. I’ll probably have to be in the right mood for it. Maybe this time next year.",,,,,,0,,,,,

It's one of the main reason I'm still active in <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword & Laser</a>. I would say calling this Sci-Fi is a bit of a stretch. Yes, there is time travel, but it's really just the vehicle for this story.<br/><br/>In fact the time travel is the part of the book I liked the most. I wish he hasn't spent so much time up front not really explaining the time travel, and simply gotten on with the story. Instead I was not only unsatisfied with his explanation for Time Travel, I was bored for two-thirds of the novel.<br/><br/>As someone who's only been to New York City once in my life, much of the marvelling about the similarities and differences of 1970s NYC and 1880s NYC were completely lost on me.<br/><br/>For me this book got going once this mystery about a letter found in the 1970's was explained by following clues in the 1880's. I think if the book had focused on this more, I would have enjoyed it a lot more.<br/><br/>Instead, it was kind of too little, too late for me. The characters were decent, but I never really connected with the protagonist. He romanticized the past as being far greater than his present. I didn't live through the 70's to compare. It's a tendency of most people to look on the past with rose-colored glasses. Si seems oblivious to many of the issues that plagued many people at that time.<br/><br/>The writing itself was fine as well.

Overall I didn't find it as funny as his Magic series, but it was still funny at times.<br/><br/>The concept of Master of Formalities guiding the rulers of the galaxy through their rules of etiquette is pretty amusing for a premise. It took a bit longer to set things up than I'd have liked.<br/><br/>The best part for me was the Sports. I don't mean like how football and baseball fall under the category of sports. It's a competition that is apparently the most important thing to the men of Jakabitus home world, while the women focus on more important things, like ruling the planet. The whole thing is just so over the top ridiculous that I found those parts especially enjoyable.<br/><br/>The characters were pretty good, though they did remind me a lot of the characters in his Magic 2.0 series, so maybe that's why.

However, I found this one to have the fewest number of slow parts yet.<br/><br/>We finally start to get answers to many of the questions I've had since the first volume. Additionally the pace seems much better. Everything feels more important to the story and the characters journey for answers and not just some exercise in writing for the author.<br/><br/>The prose are once again excellent and I find myself increasingly attached to the characters. This is especially true of Orlando, Fredricks and !Xabbu. Renie who  got on my nerves at times in the last book, was much less so in this book. Paul's plotline provides some of the best reveals of the series thus far, but I found myself a bit less interested in him as I was in the previous two books.<br/><br/>In this novel we start to finally get some convergence of several plotlines that had previously felt only loosely related to one another. We get yet even more new sim worlds to explore, but thankfully they don't seem to be explored for exploration's sake, but with real purpose to the plot. Many of the minor plotlines are starting to finally feel more important as well.<br/><br/>Unlike the previous two, where I found it was easy to take a break with something shorter/lighter, there was no way I couldn't jump into the fourth and final book with how this ends.

She has a good clear reading voice and speaks at a good volume. I didn't find her particularly memorable one way or another. I'd consider the audiobook a fine option if you want to go that route, but nothing special.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I knew nothing about this book or the author prior to this coming up for a vote in <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword & Laser</a>. It sounded the best of the choices.<br/><br/>Prior to reading it, most of what I heard was that it was incredibly bleak. Maybe I've read too much grimdark that I've grown too indifferent, but I didn't find this all that bad. It's certainly a darker and more serious book than some fantasy, but not nearly as dark as more popular series like Song of Ice and Fire or Malazan Book of the Fallen.<br/><br/>The difference may be that I cared less for Baru Cormorant than I do for some of the characters in both of those series. When bad things happened, I wasn't all that upset. And bad things don't happen the whole time, though it may feel that way to some.<br/><br/>The main point of interest to me was how the Empire of Masks used clever finance, and not military might to conquer. This reminds me a bit of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8752885-the-dragon-s-path"">Dagger and Coin</a> by [a:Daniel Abraham|134|Daniel Abraham|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1207149629p2/134.jpg]. However if I had to recommend one ""Fantasy Economic"" series, it would definitely be Dagger & Coin over this one.<br/><br/>That brings me to my next point. This is another one of those books that I think isn't being well advertised as the start of a series. I shouldn't be surprised as everything is a series these days. Things do come to a decent conclusion, but it's obvious that things are setup for a longer series fairly early on in the series.<br/><br/>This could be that this is the author's first published novel (at least I believe it is), and sequels are contingent on how well this one does. However I think it should be made clear to the potential reader that they are committing to ""yet another series"", and ideally how long. Standard trilogy? Something longer? One of the reasons I voted for this book over the others, is they were all part of series, and I didn't realize this was as well.<br/><br/>I thought the writing was pretty good, especially for a first time author. I don't recall big info dumps or painful dialogue.<br/><br/>There were definitely parts of this book I enjoyed, but it was uneven. Overall, I thought the world building of the Masked Empire was more interesting than the plot or the characters themselves. I enjoyed learning about the Mask Empire early on in the book, but by the end I found my mind wandering in places and simply eager to just finish the book. <br/><br/>The weaker ending caused me to round down my rating instead of up. At this point I'm not sure I'll continue on with the next book in the series, your mileage may vary though.",,,1,,,1,2015/10/10,Audible,Like new,,

Suffice to say, this book was excellently written.<br/><br/>The book starts off rather dark and that gave me pause, yet somehow Ms. Jemisin sucked me into the narrative so completely that I was never really bothered by it. It's not all bleakness either. Much like life there are ups and downs, albeit maybe more downs than many people experience in a lifetime.<br/><br/>The stories of Damaya, Syenite, and Essun were all engaging, and intermixed in a perfect way that while you hated to step away from one story, you were always just as happy to return to another.<br/><br/>The world building is really fascinating to me too. I have a lot of questions lingering at the end, that I hope will be addressed in the later volumes. The magic is unique and interesting. That's getting harder and harder these days. Normally I like well explained and structured magic systems the best. In this case however the mystery of the magic system and sense of discovery as the book goes on worked really well for me.<br/><br/>This book is full of social commentary, that may turn some people away who just want a ""fun"" story. It's their loss. I think Ms. Jemisin does a great job of exploring issues relevant to our own world while telling an incredibly engaging and entertaining story. In fact some of the things were so well done, that I didn't notice them at first, or didn't really give the much thought until after stopping for the day.<br/><br/>This review doesn't do this excellent book justice. I rarely give books five stars though, so that should hopefully give some idea.<br/><br/>This is a refreshing book in an oversaturated fantasy market. I hope the next two can live up to bar set by this one. In the meantime I might have to make some time to check out some of Ms. Jemisin's previous work, especially since I own the first book of each of her last two series.",,,1,,,1,2015/09/15,Audible,Like new,,

They are still worth a read if you're a die hard Dresden fan like I am though.<br/><br/>The stories all pull in different beings from the fairly rich Dresdenverse to offer a variety of issues for Harry to solve.

It covers a wide range of topics from installation/administration to table design. <br/><br/>The free documentation that comes with Accumulo is pretty good, and always getting better, but it's not really sufficient for someone who is just learning.

The further I get into Accumulo development, the more I'd like to learn about Table and Iterator design. Accumulo Iterators seem complicated enough that they could warrant a book by themselves. They cover some of the more popular table designs, and built in iterators but don't talk too much about custom design. <br/><br/>That will get you pretty far, but it doesn't really help when trying to customize applications to meet your customers needs. Things like query optimizations and how tune your design for performance are only lightly touched on.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is a very good book on Accumulo that is a great compliment to the documentation for both new and experienced Accumulo developers.

If comic books are dominating the movie theater, murder shows are the thing of choice for TV. At least network TV anyways. I got tired of it, and so I wasn't sure how much I'd like a detective murder mystery.<br/><br/>However there are very few Stephen King books that I've read that I haven't enjoyed to some degree. He writes fantastic characters that always jump off the page for me. Bill Hodges is pretty good. However for me the real star is Holly Gibney. She's probably in my top 5 favorite Stephen King characters. Considering the iconic characters Mr. King has written over the years, that's really saying something. This series wouldn't be the same without her. The interaction between her and Bill are especially excellent.<br/><br/>Without getting into spoiler territory, I wasn't really sure where this third book would be going after how things were left in the second one. Turns out Mr. King had a plot device ready to go to move the story forward. I was initially not very happy with it, but I came to accept it by the end. I'm not sure what I might have preferred as an alternative, but after awhile I was too caught in the story to really care that much.<br/><br/>There are several other returning characters in this book I was happy to see again, the top being Jerome Robinson, but especially compared to previous book it's nice to have a book where I like so many of the characters.<br/><br/>Not all of them are likable though. However even the antagonists of the book are fascinating to follow around (at least between cringes). I think Mr. King puts some of the worst thoughts and actions of humanity on display here. It gives it a sense of realism that had me glad this was fiction. <br/><br/>Thankfully the overall message I got out of this book is one of optimism. This book deals a lot in suicide, and highlights many of the reasons people may choose to take their own life. It's a dark topic, but I think he does a good job at combating that with people who love and care one another.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed this book and this series, and it's bittersweet to be done with it. I want another book (or three) with Holly Gibney. Prequel, sequel, side story. I don't care Maybe she can make an appearance or two in some of his other works like some of his other characters have. I just know I'm going to miss her like she's someone I'm friends with rather than a character in a book, which is always a sign of a great character. I look forward to seeing what Mr. King has in store for us next.",,,1,,,1,2016/06/08,Review Copy,Like new,,

Looking forward to get to book 3 soon.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I originally came onto this series after a recommendation in a thread about books similar to Firefly. Two books in, I'm hard to agree with that. Sure you have a crew flying around ship, but that's about where the similarities end for me.<br/><br/>For one thing, the characters are far less likable in this series than on Firefly. I recall coming to like them a more by the end of the first book, but whether it was the gap of time, or their general selfishness, I found myself disliking them again at the start of this book as well. You have no real closeness between any of the characters at the start. <br/><br/>They aren't really friends or comrades, so much as a bunch of people with no other place to go. At least sometimes. There has definitively been developments in both the characters and their relationships as the series has gone on.<br/><br/>Despite all of that, it was still a fun an enjoyable book. I'm not really into Steampunk, but this is fairly light on that. I'm almost more inclined to call this flintlocke fantasy much of the time. You do have airships and various mechanical based magic though. Whatever it's subgenre may be, I find the world building fascinating.<br/><br/>There is plenty of politics and mystery. First, you have the religious cult-like Awakeners and their determination to wipe out all Daemonists and anyone who opposes them. However their political clout seems to waning. <br/><br/>That is no help for the secretive Daemonists however, who must still hide their study of magic from all but a few if they wish to live. Then there are the mysterious Mane. They are considered to be violent and dangerous, but what are their true motivations? <br/><br/>Finally you have the typical mysterious pasts of the various crew members. All of this adds depth and flavor to the main story of salvaging a valuable treasure on a downed airship. The pace of the story is fast and the writing is excellent. <br/><br/>Somehow Mr. Wooding keeps his hooks in me despite writing characters I have trouble liking and caring for. Much like the last book though, I think I'm coming around on them again. We'll see if that holds up in the next book, which I hope to read much sooner than I did this one. If you haven't checked this series out yet, I highly recommend it. ",,,1,,,1,2015/11/27,Barnes & Noble,Very good,,

It's not something I normally like, but I think it's worked well for Abraham in this series. It may be problematic some though.<br/><br/>Time changes a person, and that's most dramatic in this book than it has been in any of the previous ones. I found Maati downright unlikeable.

The passage of time can have an important impact on a story. Characters mature, events are put in perspective, plans put into motion. In short: things change. <br/><br/>I'm not always a fan of big time jumps, but Mr. Abraham seems to do a good job of it. We're initially not privy to what the characters have been up to for the last 8 years or so. We discover these things over the course of the book without ever having flashback scenes. That makes me think the time jump was justified.<br/><br/>I found things maybe a little bit slower in this novel than the first one. It took a bit of time for Mr. Abraham to get the pieces in place to finally get the ball rolling, but I never found myself uninterested.<br/><br/>Very few authors can write a sort of everyday life kind of story without boring me. [a:Robin Hobb|25307|Robin Hobb|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1397885202p2/25307.jpg] is incredibly good at this. I think Mr. Abraham is as well. That said, it's the kind of story that can easily turn people away. Once again there is very little magic or action. Almost no fighting at all.<br/><br/>Everything is politically based. There are hints of a possible war on the horizon, but no armies are being mustered yet. I'm hopeful that based on where things stand at the end of this novel, should make for some pretty interesting developments in the next one.<br/><br/>The characters are once again examples of shades of grey. Most are dealing with internal conflicts raging over what course of action they should take. The world he built in the first novel wasn't really expanded much here, but it was refined a little. We get to see the politics and violence of a succession in more detail.<br/><br/>Overall I think anyone who enjoyed the first book, will enjoy this as well. While anyone who found the first book lacking, won't likely find this book any better.<br/><br/>I had the third book all downloaded and ready to go, but unexpectedly got distracted by another book.

The larger galactic issues presented in Justice seemed to take a backseat to smaller issues of a single space station.<br/><br/>This book was a bit of both, though more the latter than the former. I wondered how a book so short could wrap things up. The answer is, it can't. Not really. There are a ton of big issues largely ignored by this book, much like they were for the previous book.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean I was unhappy with the conclusion though. It's all about expectations. I think Ancillary Sword helped to prepare me for a much smaller resolution than I originally hoped for. This books wraps up most of the issues of that book nicely, to the detriment of the larger issues presented in Ancillary Justice.<br/><br/>If you're someone hoping for resolution of the galactic conflicts, you'll probably disappointed by this book.

I never expected I'd be cheering for a Space Station, but somehow I was. And that's to say nothing of Translator Zeiat who absolutely steals every scene they are in. All of the best quotes of the book can be attributed to them.<br/><br/>I really hope that Ms. Leckie does more books with this universe. I hope it's not the last we see of Breq either.

I purchased [b:His Majesty's Dragon|16415676|His Majesty's Dragon|Naomi Novik|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1431943393s/16415676.jpg|726205] awhile ago fully intending on reading it, but still haven't gotten around to it.<br/><br/>So instead I'm starting here. If her Temeraire books are anywhere near this good, I need to make time to read them soon.<br/><br/>This book started a bit slow. Then the story felt like it really got going, and the next thing I knew, I'd read 100 pages. Things slowed down some in places, but I tore through several parts of it in 100 page chunks.<br/><br/>I've heard this compared to a fairy tail. I guess that's true. I haven't really read any since I was a kid, so my thoughts never really went there. For me, it reminds me a bit of Tolkien. The description of the woods, and the largely unexplained magic and my sense of wonder at the world. <br/><br/>In fact, normally I'm firmly in the [a:Brandon Sanderson|38550|Brandon Sanderson|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1394044556p2/38550.jpg] camp on magic. I like well defined magical systems where the characters stay within the rules that the author establishes early on in the book. However the fast and loose approach to magic here didn't bother me for some reason. I can see how it might bother some though. I liked the contrast and complementary nature of Agnieszka's magic compared to the Dragon's.<br/><br/>In fact the reaction of the Dragon to her magic, is probably why it didn't bother me. He was having my typical reaction for me. Of course his magic methods weren't very well explained either, but seemed to be methodical in nature.<br/><br/>The characters took time to grow on me, but I liked Agnieszka fairly early on, and mostly liked the Dragon by the end. I enjoy the trope of the cranky old wizard, and the Dragon largely fits that exactly, with a little derivation. For anyone tired of that trope, this may be a larger issue.<br/><br/>I thought Kasia served as a nice contrast to Agnieszka, and that contrast is used nicely by the author to add depth to both of them. The pair of them make for a nice change of pace for the typical fantasy protagonists.<br/><br/>The real lure for me was the forest. I've always enjoyed camping and hiking in the woods. It's something I don't do much these days, so living vicariously through characters in a book is the next best thing.<br/><br/>These aren't woods I'd want to visit though. I was fascinated by the mystery and discovery of the woods as the story progressed. There is also some pretty interesting world building with an ancient culture that has been largely lost to time. <br/><br/>Some of the details felt a bit rushed at the end, but I'll happily take that over this being book one in a series. This story is very well self-contained. There is plenty of room to tell future stories, but this can easily be picked up and consumed by itself, which seems rare for fantasy.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this, and I plan to move Ms. Novik's other work higher up on my To read list.",,,1,,,1,2015/08/01,Amazon,unspecified,,

I always hated to stop listening, and found myself coming up with things to do so I could get in some extra listening time each day.<br/><br/>Unfortunately what seems to be Mr. Grossman's need to remind us that life is never fair and far from perfect at places, that I'm frankly sick of.

Who would have guessed that?<br/><br/>This is one of those books that doesn't tie up every loose end.

I'd love to see more stories in this world. If not with Quentin as his friends, then maybe with other students at Brakebills. Preferably ones I like much sooner. <br/><br/>I found Plumb a nice addition to the series, much as I did Poppy in the last book. It was nice to see that much like the real world, not everyone is so depressed and cynical all the time.<br/><br/>Overall I've found this an enjoyable series, which is likely obvious from how quickly I tore through it.

It makes for a great contrast.<br/><br/>I'm already looking forward to the next book in this series. It's going far too quick for my liking though.

I might never have discovered it otherwise.<br/><br/>The fact that I read this book, rather than waiting for the audio book to come out should be a good indication as to how I excited I was for it. My reading time is precious and my reading speed poor. I made sure to clear my schedule so I'd be able to jump right into this on release day.<br/><br/>The book starts with a bang. Literally. It pulls you right in and your off and running. Unfortunately I found it got a bit bogged down in the middle due to many additional POVs and sub plots. I struggled a bit, and my reading pace slowed down. This wasn't helped by a weekend trip, which is often when I do most of my reading.<br/><br/>Thankfully Mr. Naam does a good job tying all of these stories together in a meaningful way. The last 20% or so was impossible to put down and I devoured it at a record pace.<br/><br/>Apart from the pacing issues in the middle, my main complaint remains the same as for the previous books. I feel like the side effects of Nexus are completely neglected. This isn't ""hard"" sci-fi by any means, but Mr. Naam does a great job of keeping things in the realm of plausibility.<br/><br/>I was excited to see some mention that the long term effects of the drug were going to be studied, but then nothing else was mentioned, and the concept was never explored. I struggle with the idea that apart from the variance during the initial ""calibration"" phase there is no difference from person to person and the drug and Operating System just seems to work flawlessly for everyone.<br/><br/>Is this due to the Operating System being able to handle difference in brain chemistry? We see differences in capabilities of people who were exposed to the drug while their brains are still developing. Young children do better than adults, but are still not as adapt as those children exposed in the womb.<br/><br/>Too much detail would have likely bogged the story down, but I hope if Mr. Naam revisits this world in a future novel these ideas are explored in greater detail.<br/><br/>That said, much like the other books in this series, this book is a lot of fun that leaves you thinking about it long after you put it down. I wasn't really sure how things would end up, but I think it was done in such a way that I'd be content if this was the last book about Nexus Mr. Naam wrote.<br/><br/>The characters are excellent as in the previous novels. Mr. Naam offers a variety of ideas and opinions through a diverse and interesting cast of characters, where even the minor characters feel well developed. <br/><br/>Rangan's story ended up being the one I was most interested in. This was followed closely by Yuguo. I guess because they were the closest to the various protests going on, this put them on the ""front lines"" so to speak.<br/><br/>Sadly, much like the last novel, I found Sam to be a bit underutilized. This is likely a result of all the new POVs added. That isn't to say this book is hurting for female characters however.

I'll be curious to see what sort of character development Mr. Pratchett has in store for him (if any). The contrast of the big hulking human raised among dwarves who is so naive as to the point of obliviousness is highly amusing.  Especially the fact that he has to be told he's not a dwarf. I also love the hints as to his real identity that I suspect will never go anywhere, because he's perfectly content at being a guard.<br/><br/>The other highlights for me were the Librarian and the Patrician. They both had some great parts. We've seen some of the librarian in the previous books, but this is the first real interaction I recall with the Patrician. He's largely been mentioned in name only thus far.<br/><br/>The story of this one was really enjoyable as well. Some of the previous books were funny at times with memorable characters, but the story was slow or disjointed. I liked the investigation into the cult of idiots by a Captain who'd rather be drunk. There were some great surprises along the way.<br/><br/>Overall this book is clever, funny, and just downright enjoyable.

I'd been in a bit of a reading slump after my previous book, and hoped this would be a light quick read to break me of that.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that wasn't the case. It was light, and quite funny at times, and usually very quotable. I just never really got into it like I have some of the other books. I didn't care too much about the characters I guess.

When I was younger I absolutely loved ancient Egypt, pyramids and the Sphynx. I'm surprised I didn't like it more as a result.

He's awesome. Maybe not the best fit for this book, but I'd take him over just about anyone for audio books. I hope he'll be narrating the rest of the series.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>This is a hard one for me to review. I generally don't like Hard Sci-Fi too much. I read for pleasure, and I do enough thinking at work. I don't really need to spend my free time thinking hard.<br/><br/>That said, I didn't find the science too overwhelming, except maybe at the end where there was a huge infodump about folding protons. I think if you are a fan of hard sci-fi, you may love this book, where I just found it pretty enjoyable.<br/><br/>The story pulled me in slowly. I wasn't really sure what the prologue had to do with anything until maybe halfway? Possibly later. I have a hard time with names in general, especially in audio, so this was no different, but it was easy enough to keep the characters straight. There isn't a ton of POVs to deal with at least. I think my favorite is probably the no brain/mouth filter cop. His dialogue always made for some fun parts.<br/><br/>My favorite part is probably the Three Body ""game"". This is what finally pulled me completely. I'm fairly confident I would have quit it quite early on, but it's interesting to read about someone obviously far smarter than myself take on the challenge.<br/><br/>I really had no idea what this book was going to be about, and I can't say I really saw where it ended up coming, but it wasn't a total surprise either.<br/><br/>The Chinese setting makes for a breath of fresh air. If there is stuff this good coming out of China, I hope more of it gets translated soon. It seems as though Ken Liu does an excellent job with it.<br/><br/>Overall, I think an enjoyable read, and I'm looking forward to picking up the second one when the audiobook gets released.",,,1,,,1,2015/05/24,Audible,Like new,,

This one won't be for everyone, but I'd put it on par with many of his previous books.<br/><br/><b>Audio book:</b> This was my first time listening to a book narrated by Mary Robinette Kowal. She's really excellent. So excellent, that I was pretty disappointed when it changed to Will Damron for Part 3. I'm not sure why they did this. Was Ms. Kowal too busy to finish recording? Was it intentional?<br/><br/>That isn't to say Mr. Damron is a bad narrator. I just didn't like him as much as Ms. Kowal, and the change in narration was jarring. If there was any place in the book it was appropriate to change, it was with Part 3, but I think it would have been better suited if they had just stuck with Ms. Kowal.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I've been a fan of Mr. Stephenson ever since picking up [b:Snow Crash|830|Snow Crash|Neal Stephenson|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1424472532s/830.jpg|493634] back in college. I haven't read all of his books, but I've enjoyed all but 1 of those that I have.<br/><br/>I had no idea what this book was about when I volunteered to review it. Much like most of his work, it's long. The start is a bit slow, and as usual it goes off on tangents and into way more detail than is necessary on things. In some of his books, I've enjoyed those tangents and the excess of detail. In others, less so. This one was somewhere in the middle for me.<br/><br/>This is the kind of thing that will turn many readers away early on. I was never bored myself, but I wasn't really engaged in the book until nearly halfway. In a book this long, that will be too much of a commitment for many. However, I suspect if you enjoy the detail and tangents, you'll be engaged much sooner.<br/><br/>This book is split into three parts. The first part is essentially a present day disaster story. The second is largely a space opera, and the third is a bit of a post apocalyptic tale.<br/><br/>Many authors might have focused on one aspect of this story. Instead of giving us bits of history that help shaped the world of part 3, we live many of the details in parts 1 and 2. For me personally, I would have liked part 1 to be shorter with more time spent on part 3. Part 2 was my favorite of the book, but that may be because I felt despite being a third of the book, part 3 ended too soon. <br/><br/>I have questions still. A lot of them. Is Mr. Stephenson planning a sequel that will contain some of these answers? I hope so.<br/><br/>This isn't a case of a long book that abruptly ends though. For me the issue is that Mr. Stephenson did such a good job with the world building that I want more. I felt like there wasn't enough. I would have happily sacrificed much of the present day (which I found slower anyways), for more time in the future story with the world he created.<br/><br/>Mr. Stephenson doesn't spend all the time on world building either. He develops several interesting characters that are used to make most of the story character-driven. We have a largely female cast, and somewhat diverse background for most of them. <br/><br/>Overall, while this isn't my favorite Neal Stephenson book, I really enjoyed it, and I hope we get another book set in the same world that he built in part 3.",,,1,,,1,2015/07/15,Review Copy,Like new,,

At the start of the book this was more like the 2.5 area.<br/><br/>The writing is fine. The world building, though sparse was decent. And I liked Maia from the start. With the reading funk I was in, this seemed like a good option to get me out of it. But despite all that I was bored. I barely touched it for a week. I'd read maybe one chapter a night. I skipped a few nights without reading it all. There just didn't seem to be much plot.

I wasn't expecting to finish it.<br/><br/>If it hadn't been a group pick, I might have quit on it. I haven't quit on a book in years though, and I didn't hate it, I just wasn't really into it either. <br/><br/>I'm really glad I stuck with it. It was a lot of fun. I just wish the first half of it hadn't been so slow. I think that may turn a lot of people off who might end up liking it in the end as I did. There are just too many books out there to stick it out.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this deserves the Nebula it's been nominated for, but I can see why it was nominated. But I expect a lot of people will question it however. The sense of danger prevalent in most fantasy novels is never really there. The conflicts may be a bit too light/easy for some. For me though, it was just what I needed.<br/><br/>And I'm glad that it's a stand alone. That is so rare these days.

Great inflection, and pretty good accents.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>This one started a bit slow for me. I wasn't really sure where it was going to go. Once it got going, it didn't slow down again.<br/><br/>I think my favorite part of this book was the flashbacks catching us up on what Julie had been up to during the first book. I really like her alternate to Breakbills. It gave me a bit of that ""magic school"" trope that I love so much despite being essentially the complete opposite.<br/><br/>Once again though I think Mr. Grossman takes this a bit too far for a sense of realism or something? Some details of the story would have been better off edited out as far as I'm concerned. I don't feel like they added anything to the story, but that sense of gloomy malaise that bothered me in the first book.<br/><br/>Thankfully it's not nearly as constant or as thick. I think Quinton is much more likable in this book than the first. Or at least as likable as he was in the first half of that book. He does seem to have grown up a bit, and be a little less mopey. He still struggles to be happy throughout though.<br/><br/>I really like the world building here. I would have liked more detail on things. We still don't really get a good explanation on magic as I prefer. We do get some more background on the universe and magic though.<br/><br/>I generally found this book more fun than the first, though I wouldn't go so far as to call this a fun book. This series has definitely gone a different direction than I originally expected from this series, but that's not a bad thing.<br/><br/>I'll be curious to see things where Mr. Grossman takes things for the final book of the series.",,,1,,,1,2015/05/05,Audible,Like new,,

Fairly early on, I was over the fact of the narrator change. <br/><br/>In fact if he had been the narrator for the first book, I'd have no reason to complain. It's my first time listening to a book read by him. He does a good job with voices and inflection to make the audio book a good option to do this book in my opinion.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I wish there were more books like this. I'm not a big sci-fi reader, but this sort of near-future plausible technology books. The only other author I know writing this sort of thing is [a:Daniel Suarez|1956402|Daniel Suarez|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1265394868p2/1956402.jpg], and his last few books <br/><br/>Much like the first book, for me the large part of my enjoyment stems from thinking about the ideas presented here. It's one of those rare books that I keep thinking about even when I'm not reading it.<br/><br/>This book does a pretty good job further exploring the ideas introduced in the first book and setting the stage for the final book while managing not to suffer from ""middle book syndrome"".<br/><br/>The characters are once again interesting and conflicted. The ideas presented here are not black and white. That's largely the reason I think this book sticks with you even after you put it down.<br/><br/>I like that despite the fact that there are some pretty scary things that could occur if such a thing were possible, Mr. Naam makes it a point to explore some of the positive as well. That more the feasibility of the technology makes this book feel more realistic. There are good people out there. I'd like to hope more good than bad. People would use this technology for the betterment of humanity just as they would use it as a means to gain power, wealth or any other thing they might desire.<br/><br/>Much like the last book, my main complaint is that the negative side effects of the drug seemed to be mostly ignored in favor of abuses it allows humanity to do to one another. He does explore the addiction aspect a little bit. However that seems to be something that the drug/technology enables you to do, rather than an effect of its use.<br/><br/>Overall this is as enjoyable as the first. I hate to use a term like ""more of the same"" because that has a negative connotation to it.

He does voices for all the characters and really adds to Mr. Sullivan excellent story telling.<br/><br/>It's for that reason that despite dropping a substantial amount of money on the kickstarter for this book, and having early access to the ebook version (and a hardcover version on the way), I still waited for and bought the audio version. <br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I was a little apprehensive about this book. Mr. Sullivan has been working on his First Empire series for the last few years, and suddenly discovered that if he didn't publish a Riyria book by the end of the year, he wouldn't be able to do so for at least another or year or two. He did a kickstarter in order to get it out on time and seems to have written the whole thing in only a few months.<br/><br/>I should have known better. Mr. Sullivan really knows these characters well and always writes an entertaining story. It's fun to be back with Royce and Handrian. It's interesting to see how the characters have changed and grown in the original series from how they used to be. Royce has become more like Hadrian and vice-versa.<br/><br/>It's also a lot of fun to see how certain details originally came to light. There are some great nuggets in here for people who have read the original series already. I know Mr. Sullivan has tried to make an effort to make it possible to read the prequels first, but after this book, I'm not sure that's still true. I've always recommended publication order anyways, but now I'll actively recommend against reading the prequels first too. I think some of the things here will ruin their revelations (see what I did there?) in the original series.<br/><br/>Mr. Sullivan's writing is great, and the plotting is tight. He seems to mix humor, action and intrigue effortlessly. Despite knowing a lot of about the future of these characters, he was still somehow able to leave me guessing about what will happen next. <br/><br/>He largely accomplishes this by adding some excellent supporting characters. I think both Lady Dulgath and Scarlet Dodge are great additions to the world. That said, it's the banter between Royce and Hadrian that really steals the show for me. This goes double for the audio. Mr. Reynolds does such a great job bringing it to life.<br/><br/>Overall this another solid Riyria book. It's fun and light, in a genre that seems overrun with serious dark fantasy most of the time. If you haven't checked out Riyria yet, I highly recommend you do, starting with [b:Theft of Swords|10790290|Theft of Swords (The Riyria Revelations, Vol 1)|Michael J.

I definitely wouldn't have finished this book so quickly if I was reading it.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>This book starts slow, but I enjoyed meeting some of the characters and the world building. Far too many fantasy worlds are based on medieval Europe. So it's nice to have one based on Asia instead.<br/><br/>I think the best aspect of this book for me was the gods as characters. This isn't the first fantasy series to do this, but it meshed in well and added an interesting element to the overall story.<br/><br/>Things built up slowly and then finally became interesting, but then seemed to slow way down again. Then it got interesting again before slowing down as things were sort of wrapped up in the final section. This made the pacing pretty uneven to me. The fight scenes and the actual rebellion didn't do much for me. And that's a large part of this book.<br/><br/>What I did enjoy was the actual plotting and administration of government. I appreciated the contrast between Kuni, Mata and the various Kings/Emperors. In some ways it was a bit too optimistic. Kuni is far from a perfect person, but seems incredibly proficient as a leader. Meanwhile Mata is entirely too stupid. Some of the characters actions just didn't make a lot of sense to me.<br/><br/>The other main issue I had was the female characters. This book had some really great ones. Jia, Soto and another I'll refrain from naming. However it felt like it took him far too long to include them as more than just minor characters in the book. I felt Jia was especially underused. I would have liked more time and involvement from them. <br/><br/>For much of the book it seems to be yet another fantasy world where women are relegated to the side lines/dismissed by most male characters. I get that's often how things have worked in our history, but does that mean it needs to be the case in EVERY fantasy series too? I'm hopeful that will be less of the case in future books though.<br/><br/>Overall there is enough here for me to want to check out the next book, but I found myself a bit underwhelmed after all the early buzz.",,,,,,1,2015/04/08,Audible,Like new,,

Well, technically it wasn't really a novel, but a collection of short stories, but I consumed it as a novel. In a similar vein, this book is really a collection of four novellas.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why he opted to tell fewer stories this time around, but I think it was slightly to the collection's detriment. That isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, but a story I didn't enjoy as much: <i>Can Long Endure</i> now stands out a lot more as one of four stories, rather than one of thirteen. It felt much slower, and in a book this short, I'd have liked more time spent on other things instead of following around a squad of soldiers. It would have worked much better if he cut it in half, and either did more in the final story, or told another story that moved the plot along more.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the other three stories were much better.

I can't recall if we got stories from inside the Conclave in the last book, but it was a nice addition here.<br/><br/>The conclusion in <i>Stand or Fall</i> was quite good, though it felt a bit rushed due to the meandering in <i>Can Long Endure</i>. That said, considering this may be our last Old Man's War book for a long time, things are left in a good place.

I love spending times with Veronica and company, and think that the novels are a great idea that Rob Thomas should have come up with sooner.<br/><br/>This series has never been shy about discussing rape, it's been central to Veronica's character, and a plot point on the show in more than one occasion. I think it's once again handled well, though I'm probably not the right person to make those kinds of judgement calls.<br/><br/>This once again feels like an extended episode with lots of cameos and world building that should appeal to Veronica Mars fans, but probably won't do much for people new to the series.<br/><br/>Overall, still pretty enjoyable, and I'll probably pick up the next one if they put one out.

Yes I have a ton of unread ebooks, but I still prefer paper, especially when on a plane. Also, I have a book buying problem.<br/><br/>I've been meaning to check out Raymond Feist for awhile, so this seemed like a good time to finally do so. I read about half of the book during my travels home and I was enjoying it. Despite that, when I got home, I was never very quick to pick it back up, often going several days between reading sessions, when most of the time I read at least an hour each day.<br/><br/>To be fair to the book, I'm in a bit of a reading slump right now (at least in text), but a really good book would have been more likely to break me of that.<br/><br/>The setting and characters all feel pretty standard for older fantasy. The story also has many common trope including the chosen one story of a sort. Or two chosen one stories perhaps. You also have elves and dwarves; warriors and and wizards. The enemy origins and their culture however are a bit different, and the part I'm most interested in.<br/><br/>This book is definitely book 1 in a series.

It's full of cameos that don't really need to happen, but you just love to see them anyways if you're already a fan.<br/><br/>This book may be approachable to someone new to Veronica Mars, but I doubt they will get as much out of it. It probably got an extra star from me simply for being a Veronica Mars book with all the characters that come with, rather than ""Jane Private Eye"". If I wasn't already a fan, I know I wouldn't have picked this up.<br/><br/>I never cared as much about the Logan vs. Piz thing. That's certainly downplayed here. So if you were hoping for more of that, you may be disappointed. You get a fair bit of Mac, Wallace, and Keith. Also Sheriff Lamb. Pretty much everyone else is relegated to cameos.<br/><br/>The book seems to takes up right after the movie. So if you haven't already watched the TV series and the movie, I'm not sure if a lot of this will make sense.<br/><br/>The actual story itself is about on par with one of the episodes. Obviously compared to an episode or even the movie, this is much longer. As a result, You get a lot of extra ""world building"" I think the series transitions well to the page, and this seems like a smart idea to ride the momentum and fandom after the movie. <br/><br/>I've never really been a reader of mystery books, but I will likely keep reading these if they keep releasing them.

It ended up being one of my favorite reads of 2014.<br/><br/>Not only was it well written and engrossing, but it was a stand alone! Who does that? No one anymore it seems like. While the world Mr. Bennett built was fascinating and large enough to accommodate many stories, I didn't feel I needed another one.<br/><br/>So when I found out he was going to be writing a sequel to it after all, I was apprehensive. Would riding the popularity of the first book lessen it? If an author writes a book as a stand alone, would a sequel he never intended to write be any good? In this case, the answer is it turns out to be even better. At least for me.<br/><br/>I found Mulaghesh to be an excellent supporting character in the first book. I was intrigued by the idea of her being the protagonist. Of course it didn't hurt that the rumor was we'd get more of Sigurd as well. <br/><br/>The change of protagonist and location made this book feel mostly like another stand alone story set in the same world. However, unlike the first book, I don't think you can just pick this up on it's own. It still builds on the foundation of the first book, while largely being it's own thing. Also, unlike the first book, it does a lot more to set up another book which looks to be on the way sometime next year.<br/><br/>I found the city Voortyashtan just as fascinating as Bulikov, while being completely different.

She was a good compliment and contrast to Mulaghesh. Both are smart, capable and determined, but Signe is much more an intellectual. It helped (though not enough) to offset the lack of Shara.<br/><br/>This was one of those books I had a hard time putting down, and would have read it far faster if ""real life"" hadn't kept conspiring to take up my reading time. It's for that reason I ended up giving it a very rare 5 stars. My typical criteria for 5 star books are those I can't put down and stay with me when I do. This book definitely fit that. It's the sequel I didn't know I wanted. <br/><br/>Now I just hope that Mr. Bennett can pull it off again with a third novel, because after this book, I definitely want another.",,,1,,,1,2016/01/27,Amazon,Very good,,

Add that in with the non-Cosmere[b:Firefight|15704459|Firefight (Reckoners, #2)|Brandon Sanderson|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1413220816s/15704459.jpg|21979689] that I liked even less and his last two books were letdowns for me.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I came into this one nervous. Was I outgrowing Mr. Sanderson? Was his breakneck output finally showing in the quality of his books? Other Sanderson fans seems to disagree with me about [b:Shadows of Self|16065004|Shadows of Self (Mistborn, #5)|Brandon Sanderson|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1435053013s/16065004.jpg|21855448], so I was really apprehensive I was outgrowing him.<br/><br/>After reading this book, I think the answer is a little of both. I'm probably less forgiving than I was, and likely much less forgiving than many Sanderson fans. When this book <a href=""http://brandonsanderson.com/state-of-the-sanderson-december-2014/"">was announced</a>, Mr. Sanderson admitted to struggling with the previous one:<br/><br/><i>""jumping into Shadows of Self was slow going, and I found it much easier to go write the sequel to refresh myself on the world and characters. That done, I was able to move back to Shadows of Self and finish it up.""</i><br/><br/>So personally, I think that struggle showed in the final product. This book however, is classic Sanderson. My worries have been alleviated for the most part. I really enjoyed this one. In fact it's now one of my favorites of the series, and I think the best Wax & Wayne book to date.<br/><br/>So why is that? Well for me it's largely because of Sterris. She's quickly become my favorite character. I often struggle with Mr. Sanderson's jokes in general. I consider it a weak point in his writing. The groan factor of his jokes for Wayne are a very close second to his jokes in the Reckoner series, and those are intentionally bad. Sterris had me cracking up though. I'm not sure if it's intentional or not. If so, then maybe Mr. Sanderson is simply better at subtle humor than outright jokes. Of course humor is always subjective. I've had people argue with me that they enjoy his humor. To each their own.<br/><br/>Mostly, I just love Sterris' character development as this series has gone on. I'm sure it has a lot to do with self-identification with some of her neurocies. Her constant planning, and making of lists are things I find myself doing a lot. Although, not nearly as detailed as she does. Either way, she's a great compliment for Wax.<br/><br/>Like all Mistborn books (and really Sanderson books in general), the magic system is top-notch. He once again finds new and interesting ways to use the magic while mostly staying within the bounds he's previously established. When he does cross those bounds, he does so in a way that feels like we're simply learning more details about magic we didn't know before, not that he's breaking rules. And of course the action is excellent. <br/><br/>Most of all though, he's building a really interesting story. Cool magic, fast-paced action and great characters are all well and good, but it was the mysteries of The Set and the Bands of Mourning that had me hating to stop listening, and were enough to finally motivate me to hook up my trainer so I could get an extra 30-45 minutes of audio in each day.<br/><br/>I'm really happy with this book. This book ends in a decent enough place at least. Things are set up nicely, without leaving you on a giant cliffhanger.

It's only taken 3 books. >.<<br/><br/>I found this book a bit slow in places, especially at the start. It largely feels like a setup book. There are some good parts. I especially like the Blackguard training.<br/><br/>For me it's the world building, magic system, and politics that keep my interest. I find most of the characters if not unlikable, certainly a bit off putting. There are characters I do like though. In particular Ironfist and Teia.<br/><br/>There are some really interesting OMG Spoiler type developments here. Definitely took a few turns I didn't see coming.<br/><br/>It also ends on an awful cliffhanger. Having read all three books almost back to back, it's frustrating to catch up and have to wait.

It contains all the same elements that drove me nuts in the first book: Cartoonish villains, juvenile wish fulfillment, and stupid and obnoxious characters; albeit in lesser quantities.<br/><br/>I think it's a combination of things. I love the magic school trope, and we get a lot of that here, at least to some degree. We also get more of Iron Fist who was probably the only character from the first book I liked the entire time. There is the addition of Teia, who I like a lot despite sharing some of the same annoying characteristics of Karris. However, she's got more of an excuse.<br/><br/>You also finally get a lot more explanation of the magic that I found lacking in the first book. There is still a hand waving, but I found myself no longer caring as much.<br/><br/>Kip is still obnoxious though. I think this book would be a lot better with a different protagonist. I like the idea of doing a parody of the chosen one trope, and I think it works well for this series. I just wish he did it different somehow. I did find myself much more tolerant of Kip by the end of the book however, but far from liking him.<br/><br/>Gavin and Karris are both mostly enjoyable, though some of their parts were pretty eye rolling. Andross Guile makes for an interesting antagonist at times, but is over the top in his actions far too often. At least he's less of a cartoon character than some of the other antagonists.<br/><br/>I think that this series is going to be relegated to ""guilty pleasure"". I don't find it to be a book that can be held up as excellent as some might, but it is a lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to the next book much more than I was looking forward to this one.",,,1,,,1,2014/12/06,Audible,Like new,,

In this volume however, Mr. Wexler found the perfect balance of military and politics and stepped up to magic to create his best novel to date.<br/><br/>His characters are excellent. This is especially true for Winter, Janis and Raesinia. He seems to have more diverse and interesting female characters than just about anything else I'm reading these days, and that includes works by female authors. There are characters to love, characters to hate, and several you love to hate. Through three books, I still have no idea what Janis's motivations and goals truly are. I can't wait to find out!<br/><br/>And if that weren't enough, the world building and magic is fascinating. The magic has been fairly downplayed in the first two books, mostly relegated to motivation for character action, with very little on-screen time.

Thankfully !Xabbu was there to help that story along.  The most interesting plotline for me was probably Orlando, though Paul's story was pretty good as too.

I really loved that series and can't wait for the follow on series.<br/><br/>I was disappointed with Tor's decision to release this book around the same time as several other SFF books I was eagerly awaiting, making fitting it in a challenge. June or August would have been better for me personally. I'm sure that sort of thing will vary from person to person, but I only know one other person who read this book so far.<br/><br/>However, I was eager to support him with his first ""big"" publisher release, and see how well he could write in a different world. My results were a bit mixed.<br/><br/>Most of my issues are expectations. With a book called Time Salvager and a synopsis saying how the protagonist: ""<i>James is a chronman, undertaking missions into Earth's past to recover resources and treasure without altering the timeline</i>"" I expected there to be far more time travel than there was. To be fair, there is a decent amount by the end, it was just not what I expected.<br/><br/>I do think Mr. Chu does a good job with the Time Travel. Then again, I'm not a hard sci-fi person who gets caught up in thinking out the consequences/side effects of time travel. Thankfully I don't have to, as many of those things are addressed in the book.<br/><br/>I also didn't realize this was the first book of a series. I guess I should have either assumed so (stand alone books are a dying breed lately) or maybe I just missed that the first time I read a synopsis. When you're nearing the end of a book you think to be stand alone, wondering how the author is going to wrap things up, and it just sort of ends, that's extremely jarring.<br/><br/>After reading his Tao series, I also expected his characters to be a lot more likeable. I came around on some of them in the end, but I despised most of them for a large portion of the book. That's likely by intention, but I have a much harder time reading books with characters I don't like. James character developed as the book went on, making him more likeable. Meanwhile Levin didn't really change at all, he simply was made more likeable by his proximity to another character far more despicable.<br/><br/>The thing is, I always enjoyed reading this book when I picked it up. The writing is excellent, the action is good, and the world building is interesting. There is far less humor in it than his Tao books. That's probably appropriate given the world he's built, but the humor was one of the best parts of those books for me.<br/><br/>For some reason though, I just never was in a rush to pick it back up, which is part of why it took me so long to read it. I suspect if I had different expectations going in, or on a reread I'll like this one a bit more. <br/><br/>I do plan to pick up the sequel. Things end in a pretty awful place. I want to know what happens next. It's always hard to stop books in a series.

It's a toss up for me between Soft Targets and Unresolved as the best story of this volume. I guess because they are the ones involving Batman villains? Life is Full of Disappointments and Daydreams and Believers were just basic cop stories that could have just as easily been set somewhere else.

Better known as an actor than an audiobook narrator, he nevertheless does a good job here. I'm not sure what to hope for with a non-fiction narrated apart from clear speech, good volume and inflection. You get all of that here. I tend to prefer to consume non-fiction in audio, and this is definitely a good option for this book.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>If you ask people their opinion of Steve Jobs, you may get a wide variety of answers. To many he was this brilliant innovator and designer, with a cult-like following. To me though, he's largely been an overpraised Asshole who got more credit than he deserved. <br/><br/>This book has changed my opinions somewhat. 1) He's a larger asshole than even I thought. 2) He does deserves more of the credit that I was was willing to give him for several key impacts to technology and culture.<br/><br/>I earn my living as a Software Engineer. My love of computers came at an early age. My first computer: An Apple IIgs. I came to learn this was basically a souped up version of the original Apple II with improvements borrowed from the Macintosh after that failed to be a success and Steve Jobs was maneuvered out of power at Apple.<br/><br/>While to most people that will never be a device of significance, it changed my life. I still have it. I still love it. It's also the only Apple product I've ever owned, and I wasn't the one who bought it, my parents were. <br/><br/>I've always had a hate/love relationship with Apple. I can appreciate the innovations of many Apple products: The Mac, The iPod, iPhone and iPad. But I've never wanted to own one. I find the closed nature of their products and lack of customization frustrating and a deal breaker. Steve Wozniak is my favorite Apple Steve, not Mr. Jobs.<br/><br/>Without Steve Jobs, some of these products may never have come to be, and certainly not as early. And they certainly wouldn't have been Apple products. <br/><br/>He didn't really design or innovate much though. What he did was push his talented engineers to innovate and accomplish things even they didn't think possible. He largely did this by being an asshole. Constantly. Calling people's ideas shit one week then taking credit for them as his own the next. Oh and that doesn't get into all the issues he had as a father or friend.<br/><br/>I could never have worked for Apple or Jobs. I probably wouldn't have been up to his standards anyways. As a huge computer/technology fan though, this is a must read book. Like him or hate him you can't disregard his impact on not only technology but culture.<br/><br/>My Windows PC (or Linux PC for that matter) wouldn't be the same without the Mac (although I think far too many people are unaware of the innovations of Xerox PARC engineers). My Android phone wouldn't be nearly as good without the iPhone.<br/><br/>My favorite quote from this book came from Bill Gates who said something to the effect that a closed system can work, but only with Jobs at the helm. I think Apple without Steve Jobs isn't nearly as good. I don't think that's because Tim Cook isn't an asshole though. It's because what Steve Jobs had was vision, and good taste for design. Not to mention amazing showmanship. I just don't like his products. But Apple fans are legion, and for good reason.<br/><br/>The Open vs. Closed debate rages on. Both sides have their merits. First it was Apple and Microsoft, now Apple and Google. I'm firmly on the open side, but understand why the closed side is so popular/successful.<br/><br/>Now it feels like innovation has largely stalled as companies are trying to push several technologies (I'm looking at you Smart Watches) that no one seems to really want or care about, and releasing only minor upgrades in hardware and software every year, rather than doing anything groundbreaking. I just hope Apple can start innovating again soon, because we can use the competition again.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs was a complicated person. I'm thankful for his contributions to technology. I'm also thankful I never knew him.",,,1,,,1,2016/03/04,,Like new,,

I know there are multiple versions of the audiobook. I'm not sure how easy they are to get a hold of, but this one seems like a good option.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I've never read anything by Mr. Bradbury before. I'm not really well read in the ""classics"". There is too much modern stuff I want to read, and in general I prefer fantasy to Sci-Fi. But when Brilliance Audio was releasing some of his better known works on Audio CD (although the production itself was done by Audible) last year, I jumped at the chance to finally give him a try.<br/><br/>I've been in a bit of a reading funk this year, and was trying to figure out what to read AFTER this book to get me out of it. Since it was short though, I wanted to listen to it sooner rather than later, write up my review then move onto something else.<br/><br/>Apparently I just needed to listen to this. Apart from one story (Way in the Middle of the Air) which made me really uncomfortable and showed it's age. It appears to have been eliminated from several of the more recent editions of this book, and I wish I had skipped it as it really adds very little to this collection.<br/><br/>Everything else was enjoyable. A bit depressing, but enjoyable. Mr. Bradbury paints a bleak picture of a future that thankfully never came. This isn't hard sci-fi by any means, but more like dystopian space opera.<br/><br/>I would have never thought something bleak would lighten my mood, but the stories were that good, and the prose are excellent. They reminded me a lot of the Twilight Zone, although I know these stories predate that show. I think The Silent Towns could easily have been an episode of the show, as could several others.<br/><br/>I think my favorite of the collection is Usher II. I can't pretend to get all the references apart from Poe and Lovecraft, but his tale of revenge for censorship is quite good. I'll have to check out the Poe story [b:The Fall of the House of Usher|175516|The Fall of the House of Usher|Edgar Allan Poe|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1387708966s/175516.jpg|15570703] that seems to have influenced it.<br/><br/>Overall this is an excellent collection of stories, and if like me you haven't read it/anything by Mr. Bradbury, this seems like as good a place as any to start.",,,1,,,1,,,Like new,,

I'm too much of a lightweight to keep up with them. But I sure do seem to love reading about them.<br/><br/>As a long time D&D player this story just seemed to press all the right buttons for me. On the surface it's your pretty standard party. You've your halfling thief/assassin, a human (I think?) cleric, an elven mage, and a dwarven warrior. But their battle plans and tactics are just ludicrous, and totally awesome all at the same time.<br/><br/>And if that wasn't enough, the humor is just excellent.

I've seen comments about realistic body images, and I can't really speak too much to that, but I have watched plenty of anime and read many comics with unrealistic body images, so I can say the characters seem more realistic to me. And of course they are wearing proper armor for their class and not the standard +10 bra of super defense.<br/><br/>But more importantly (to me anyways) the artwork is really excellent in general.

While I wouldn't call it a prerequisites for this book, I would highly recommend reading those books first. There are so many great rewards in the book for people who have. If you haven't, I doubt you'll be lost, but you won't get the same enjoyment in my opinion.<br/><br/>It's pretty much impossible for me to get into why I loved this book more than the last one without massive spoilers. I suspect most longtime fans will share my excitement however.<br/><br/>That said, despite getting one of my rare 5 star ratings (this is only the second book by Ms. Hobb I've given that too), there are some complaints. Or maybe not complaints so much as things I wish weren't in this book. I found them very upsetting. I'd have preferred some kind of alternative reason used to drive the plot forward. I suspect some people may be more upset than I was, and others may be more indifferent.<br/><br/>Overall though, those were very minor things to me in an absolutely fantastic book. I will warn that if you hate cliffhangers, you may wish to avoid reading this book until we're much closer to the release of the next book. It is a pretty big one. With it being the second book of a trilogy, and how the first book ended, I can't say I'm very surprised.<br/><br/>Much like the last one, I am both nervous and excited to read the next one and see what Ms. Hobb has in store.",,,1,,,1,2015/08/04,Review Copy,Like new,,

It reminds me more of [a:Daniel Suarez|1956402|Daniel Suarez|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1265394868p2/1956402.jpg] than the stuff of his I have read. If nothing else this book renews my desire to read some more of his work.<br/><br/>This one is hard to categorize. I'd guess techo-thriller is maybe the best? It's also a time travel book. Sort of. The time stuff definitely falls into the Back to the Future 2 category (altering the past forks it to a new future).<br/><br/>I think both protagonists are pretty good, though Flynne is easily the better of the two. She keeps herself together way better than I would under the circumstances she faces. Netherton is much less interesting, and took me a bit to warm up to, but by the end, I enjoyed his chapters almost as much as Flynne's. Though that may simply be due to the amount of overlap of the two.<br/><br/>The world building could have been a little better. There is this mysterious Jackpot, that while explained eventually, wasn't really explained in a lot of detail. I guess it was to move the plot along more than anything. We get glimpses of both Flynne's and Netherton's worlds, though not as much as I'd have liked.<br/><br/>There is a bunch of technology in this one. Some of it looks familiar like tablets and drones. The rest of it sounds familiar like robots, advanced haptic controls, and embedded phones. There is no big dreaming here. Everything Mr. Gibson writes seems feasible, and some of it probably not too far off.<br/><br/>At it's core though, this is really just a thriller. There are shady characters and a mysterious murder drives the plot. I probably would have preferred something more cyberpunk, but I have no idea if still writes those kinds of books anymore.<br/><br/>I found it a quick listen, at just over fourteen hours I did most of it over a busy weekend of chores and bike riding. Not a bad choice if you're looking for something shorter to fit in between other reads like I was.",,,1,,,1,2014/10/19,Review Copy,Like new,,

Thankfully that's been remedied in this book. While they aren't POV characters again, they do feature fairly heavily in the plot, albeit Bobbie moreso than Avasarala.<br/><br/>The other problem was I always found at least 1 or 2 of the POV to be less interesting than the others. The best part is that instead of forcing the readers to deal with some new characters they won't like as much, they chose to make the other 3 POVs the remaining members of the Rocinante.

I'm hard pressed to pick a favorite plotline. They were all just so good.<br/><br/>So apart from excellent choice for POVs what really makes this book so great is the focus of the story. The stuff with the protomolecule in the last 4 books has been interesting, but this book mostly takes a break from that.<br/><br/>The tensions have long been bubbling between the 3 human factions of Earth, Mars and The Belt/OPA have finally come to a head.

That may upset some fans, but for me it breathed new life into a series that seemed in danger of losing its way.<br/><br/>Some characters in this book made me so mad!

It's been about a year since then, and my memory on the details were fuzzy. I should have reread. I wish there was a wiki or something with plot points and character bios I could have used to refresh myself.<br/><br/>I struggled at the start remembering many of the minor characters. I think all books in a series (and really all audio books in general) should have a list of the important characters with maybe a 1 sentence reminder of who they are. It would really help a lot. There are just too many books to reread previous books every time a new one comes out, even books I loved as much as the last two.<br/><br/>Both of those books grabbed me early on and never let go.

It's not really science fiction. It's really just a thriller with a technical starting point. Just like cryptography serves as a backdrop for that book, Gaming (particularly MMO's) does so here. <br/><br/>Only while the cryptography serves as a pretty constant part of that story, things take a 90 degree turn away from the MMO stuff here for awhile. I initially found that very disappointing. I'm a recovering World of Warcraft junkie and I was hoping for some kind of cyberpunk MMO story. That's not the case though, so if that's what you're looking for as well, you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>While we start off in typical Neal Stephenson fashion with immense detail about the design and development of T'Rain, and a virus associated with it called Reamde, this book is really more of a character driven thriller that feels almost more like a spy novel than anything sci-fi.<br/><br/>With a book this long, and Mr. Stephenson's tendency to go into more detail on certain things than is ever necessary, I found it got bogged down in parts and just wishing he would get back to the game.<br/><br/>However as things went on, I really came to like his characters. I never found anyone's story to be too uninteresting or slow, it was really some of his tangents that were the problem, and general lack of Richard Forthrast, whom the blurb leads you to believe is the main character. He's not. He's an important party, but really this is his niece Zula's story. <br/><br/>I found he to be a really enjoyable protagonist. The characters in this book have far more depth than some of his others, but this one will live or die on how much you like the characters I think. Zula is smart, capable and level-headed who continually tries to make the best of bad situations. Things maybe get a little bit close to ""chosen one"" levels, but for the most part I think Mr. Stephenson does a good job in creating a back story to make things stay closer to ""feasible"" than fiction.<br/><br/>So will you enjoy this one? Hard for me to say. If you liked [b:Cryptonomicon|816|Cryptonomicon|Neal Stephenson|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1327931476s/816.jpg|1166797] then maybe. If you enjoy spy thrillers, then probably. If you're looking for a cyberpunk story, or a video game story, then probably not. I for one ended up enjoying this despite it not being what I expected it to be.<br/><br/><br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I've seen all the movies, but very few episodes. I've watched all of the other series though. It's quite possible I missed a bunch of jokes as a result. There were definitely a few Next Generation jokes in there I got, especially one about everyone's favorite Ensign.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed most of the Malazan Fallen series, and I'm a big Star Trek fan, so I had pretty high hopes for this. Despite being ""Grimdark"" there are some really funny parts in Malazan, especially among the Marines. I think that sort of humor is harder to write, but maybe not. Humor is always hard in general. What one person finds hilarious the next person might find dumb.<br/><br/>With any humor or satire book, you are largely made and broken by the quality of the laughs. This book had some pretty hilarious parts, but often I was fairly uninterested in the characters and the plot.<br/><br/>The actual writing itself is fine, but story is so ridiculous at times that I just didn't care. The main character is intentionally an asshole. I kind of got tired of that by the end. For what the book is, it was fine, and I don't regret reading it.

I hope that Expanse doesn't keep Mr. Abraham away from fantasy for too long (even though I love that too). 4.5 stars.<br/><br/><b>Audiobook:</b> Pete Bradbury does an excellent job with the narration. I love his voices and the inflections when he reads. My only minor complaint is at times he can be difficult to hear. He's a bit soft spoken, and I wish they had adjusted the volume up a bit to compensate. Overall though, I think audio is an excellent option for this series.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>After reading and falling in love with the Expanse books  a few years ago, I went looking for other books by the authors I might enjoy. I opted to go with this series over his completed Long Price Quartet for some reason, though I ended up reading that too while waiting for this book to come out.<br/><br/>I haven't read another series quite like this one. Most fantasy series completely ignore economics all together and focus on magic and combat. If they do include economic issues they are a minor issue most of the time. Mr. Abraham not only includes economics, but he makes it front and center. Some people might read that and think the story would be boring, but I think Mr. Abraham does an excellent job.<br/><br/>This series at its core is about power. The power of military strength (dagger) and the power of the banks (coin). Through some of the best character development I've ever read, we follow the story of two people on their path to power by very different means.<br/><br/>More than anything, it's the characters and their development that makes this series shine for me. I've never been so conflicted by an antagonist as from this series. Geder's an absolute monster, with largely good intentions. I started out liking him for the most part. He's a bit of a nerd with self esteem issues, something I can identify with. But he's got a really bad temper. Given power, he's quick to make those he feels are laughing at him pay.<br/><br/>Meanwhile you have Cithrin who started out a bit flat and annoying for me, but grew to be a really interesting and complex character. I never really identified with her and her motivations at all, but I always enjoyed reading about them. Through Cithrin, Mr. Abraham made economics pretty interesting for me.<br/><br/>Marcus is on the surface a standard fantasy trope character. The grizzled military veteran haunted by his past. However, Mr. Abraham does a great job giving him depth that elevates him above a mere trope. Some of my favorites bits of dialogue in the whole series are the banter between him and Master Kit, Yardem, or Inys.<br/><br/>My favorite character though has to be Clara. Her development as the series goes on outdoes even Geder's. In a genre that is severely lacking in female characters, Mr. Abraham decides to focus on a 50-something women. She offers a nice contrast to the other characters. She's conflicted about her place in the world, but doesn't let that stop her from accomplishing her goals. She's politically savvy without being unlikable or conniving. She's not quite as good as Avasarala from the expanse, but is definitely a close second.<br/><br/>In addition to the excellent POV characters, the supporting cast was well done too. I'm particularly fond of Yardem, Master Kit and all of the actor company. This world feels large in scope and it's minor characters and a lot of depth to the story.<br/><br/>This book was delayed a few times, likely due to Mr. Abraham's involvement in both the Expanse novels and the TV series. I felt it was worth the wait. The book comes to a decent stopping place, and resolving many of the major conflicts, without wrapping things up in a nice bow. There are still issues to be resolved, but I'm perfectly content leaving them where they are.<br/><br/>And on top of all that, I LOVED the epilogue of the book. It was not only very satisfying, but I felt it offered really nice symmetry with the prologue of [b:The Dragon's Path|8752885|The Dragon's Path (The Dagger and the Coin, #1)|Daniel Abraham|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1292362307s/8752885.jpg|13626110].

I've enjoyed this series so much that now I've caught up and have to wait a year or more for the next and final book. Thankfully unlike some other authors it seems like I won't have to wait too long for the conclusion, and that will definitely be a release day read for me.<br/><br/>Once again this is a very character-driven story that focuses on economics and politics more than magic and battles. There is a lot of fighting going on, but we usually only see the before or the after and very little fighting. <br/><br/>Similarly there is magic, but it's all very hand wavy and not well fleshed out. In fact one of the characters wonders why so many practitioners make their money by doing tricks and aren't utilized in fighting only to be told that conjuring fire isn't nearly as effective in the long term as a bow and arrow.<br/><br/>I liked this book a little less than the last one however. I think it's partially due to Clara's chapters for the first half of the book. She felt more like a camera than an important character. For awhile I was wondering why exactly she was doing what she was, but by the end it made sense and I she might have regained her status as my favorite character.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Marcus's chapters are probably are probably the most interesting. Anyone who finished the last book should be able to guess why that is.<br/><br/>This book really highlights the differences of obtaining power by using military might and money. The title Dagger and Coin was well chosen by Mr. Abraham as we see both approaches to gaining power and attempts to bring about ""peace"" and order.<br/><br/>I really enjoy this series, which should be obvious if you look at how quickly I've listened to it. It's nice to have a fantasy series that feels realistic without being ""grimdark"". Plus I really enjoy the characters and the importance of money not being glossed over or relegated to minor subplot. <br/><br/>If my last 3 reviews haven't convinced you, hopefully this one will to catch up with the series before the final book comes out.",,,1,,,1,2014/08/27,Audible,Like new,,

He's also written some great dialogue, especially as the characters are paired up with different people and put into different situations.<br/><br/>Mr. Abraham does a great job of shades of grey.

However, I'd like to see him write a different type of story next as post-apocalyptic stories really aren't my thing.<br/><br/>In this one the world is buried under sand and water is scarce. The daring and (maybe a bit crazy or stupid) use specialized equipment to dive deep under the sand and recover anything deemed valuable to be traded for money and supplies and just to get by.<br/><br/>The story is once again split up into multiple parts. The early books seems to each focus on a single POV, while the later ones jump around between them. All of our POV characters are from the same family. The children ranging in age from 10 to late 20's I believe.<br/><br/>The oldest, Vic (short for Victoria not Victor) is probably my favorite though all of her younger brothers are interesting in their own right.<br/><br/>It's a dangerous world full of thieves, murders and revolutionaries. Like his Silo books, the central story is a bit of a mystery. What happened? Why is the world buried under Sand? And on a smaller scale, what happened to the father of kids who walked off into the desert one night 10 years ago and never returned?<br/><br/>This was a short and enjoyable read. As it's post apocalyptic it's more on the dark side so I'm reluctant to call it ""light"", but it can certainly be called an easy read. There isn't a ton of depth here, but it moves along at a quick pace. I'd say if you enjoyed his previous books you'll likely enjoy this one as well.<br/><br/>3.5 Stars.",,,1,,,1,2014/08/20,Review Copy,Like new,,

So I was really excited to find out this book would be out in December and I only had to wait a few months. Only the book got delayed due to issues with the publisher. NERD RAGE!!<br/><br/>This built up an even bigger sense of anticipation. In the meantime I kept recommending the series to friends. As a result by the time this came out a handful of us did a group read over in my group <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/99675-the-not-a-book-club-club"">The Not a Book Club Club</a>.<br/><br/>This ended up being the best one yet. I had been reading it only a bit at a time in order to savor it. Then I realized that Daredevil was out on Netflix and I suddenly was conflicted. I didn't have enough time to do both. By the end of the weekend this won out. Easily. I read the last 40% in one day, which for me is a lot. I couldn't put it down. It's for that reason I've given it only my second 5 star rating of the year so far.<br/><br/>In a genre overrun with gritty dark fantasy and post apocalyptic stories, this series is a breath of fresh air. That isn't to say everything is sunshine and unicorns, but Mr. Chu does an excellent job of mixing action, adventure with humor to keep the seriousness of events from weighing you down too much as you read.<br/><br/>The one thing I missed in this book was all the really excellent Retconning of Human history to fit the Quasings in.

I just didn't think Mr. Abercrombie could do YA well. And that book seemed to prove me right. It was alright, but it felt just flat and uninteresting.<br/><br/>So I was even more reluctant to pick this one up. My hold for the library seemed to get held up, and I was OK with that. The early reviews I saw for this book were all pretty positive though. They all seemed to use the phrase ""much better than [b:Half a King|18666047|Half a King (Shattered Sea, #1)|Joe Abercrombie|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1389378321s/18666047.jpg|25641726]"". I'm now adding my voice to that statement.<br/><br/>This is more like it. Compared to his First Law books, things are still toned down, but compared to the first book things are a lot more gritty and all around interesting. <br/><br/>The first improvement I found is that Yarvi is no longer a POV character. I didn't care much for him in the last book. I thought him a much more interesting character as viewed from the outside than from within. However the difference could also be that some time has passed as he's developed from annoying boy into interesting young man. It's hard to say for sure.<br/><br/>The next improvement is his new POV characters. Thorn and Brand are a lot more memorable and well developed than most of the characters in Half the World. They also contrast each other nicely. Thorn is a bit reminiscent of Monza Murcatto or Ferro Maljinn. Brutal, fierce, and angry.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Brand reminds me a bit of Collem West. He has a good heart, and sometimes pays the price for it. Neither character is recycled though. Instead he revisits some old ideas in new ways.<br/><br/>Being a YA book, I guess it's required to have some awkward  will they / won't they love subplots or something? I could have probably done without it, but overall I thought it was handled fairly well.<br/><br/>The world building continues to be a bit sparse, but interesting. The elven ruins and magic intrigues me. My discussion group brought up the similarities to modern technology. Is this really a post apocalyptic version of our world? We know there was some sort of major catastrophe in the past. I'd really like to know more about this aspect, but I don't think we'll ever really know.<br/><br/>Parts of the books were a bit predictable still, yet still a pleasure to read. It was a real page turner through most of it. Plus, some things didn't go quite as I expected however, so I was never bored.<br/><br/>Overall this book does a great job of stepping things up and setting the stage for the final book without feeling too much like a middle book.

This book is well written. Part mystery, part fantasy, with some pretty good humor. More ""urban"" fantasy than traditional fantasy, or maybe this could be considered ""flintlock"". The subgenre doesn't really matter too much though. It's more important to get across that this book feels very fresh and pretty light on fantasy tropes.<br/><br/>Mr. Bennett paints a rich and deep world, especially for a stand alone book of only 450 pages. The little bits of text from various fictional books really helped to flush things out in a short amount of text. And unlike Malazan these were cryptic entries that really only make sense to a rereader, but were at worst something to file away for later in the book, but usually for later in that chapter.<br/><br/>And if world building doesn't do much for you, then there are the characters. The main character, Shara, is a 30 something intelligent women who uses his brains rather than a weapon to do most of her fighting. However when violence is called for her ""secretary"", Sigrud is there to handle it. In many ways Sigrud almost steals the show, but that's really just because he like a few of the other supporting characters are so strong.<br/><br/>And if characters and cool world building aren't enough, there is a pretty interesting ""magic"" system, that's tied in well with the aforementioned world building.<br/><br/>The last thing I want these days is another series to read. This book is definitely stand alone, but I would totally read another book set in this world, and it sounds like I may get that. I had never heard of Mr. Bennett before this book, but I'll definitely be looking into some of his work. <br/><br/>Highly recommended.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The fourth, Riva, was probably my favorite. As a new character she probably got the most character development of the four. I think having two male POVs and two female ones gave the novel a good balance.<br/><br/>I found Lyrna's story to start a bit slow, but I was quickly grabbed by the book as a whole and eventually sucked into her narrative as well.

I hated to put it down and loved to pick it back up.<br/><br/>I'm glad for the format change as I think Mr. Ryan was able to tell a much larger story as a result. There were parts of the story where the various POV's overlapped, but there were also a lot of things that would have gone otherwise unmentioned if he stuck with just Vaelin's story.<br/><br/>We are once again given some excellent action scenes, though probably fewer overall than the first. While the first book was more a hero's journey, this book is more epic fantasy with larger implications to the realm as a whole.<br/><br/>We get answers to many of the big questions I had from the first novel too. Often times it seems like authors jealously guard all their book's secrets and wait until the last possible minute to reveal them. Not so with this series. I felt there were several big reveals in parts 2 and 3 that other authors might have held back.<br/><br/>There is plenty of new questions to take the place of those that are answered that kept me wanting to keep listening and find out what would happen next.<br/><br/>Mr. Ryan has put himself in a precarious position of writing two really excellent novels in what I believe is supposed to be a trilogy.

I like the concept of mirror worlds a lot. That's probably the thing that will keep me reading this series. It's really a sort of epic fantasy novel with a sci-fi twist.<br/><br/>My main issue with this book was the characters. I just never connected with any of them. It's one thing to make ""grey"" characters who are neither good or bad, but they have to be likable. I need to understand why they live in that gray area, and it can't be because they are selfish and do whatever they want to without any thought to the consequences or how it will impacts others.<br/><br/>I was pretty excited at the idea of a matriarchal society to change things up. This may be an unpopular opinion, but it just came off feeling gimmicky to me. Maybe the idea was that you can put female characters into the same roles as male ones and nothing would change, but if so that doesn't work for me. I want it to be different. <br/><br/>Her characters didn't feel like women to me. That isn't to say they needed to be defer to a guy, or staying behind while men do all the fighting. Several other writers have created vicious women, strong women, smart women that break the tropes for women in fantasy while still feeling like women to me.<br/><br/>Most of Ms. Hurely's characters felt like male characters shoved in women's bodies. She plays with gender in this book a bit too. People can sort of choose what gender they want to be, and one of the character's genders is constantly changing. None of that bothers me, but I am sort of confused about it's relevance to the story. Maybe there isn't one, or maybe we'll find out later. I'll be curious to see which.<br/><br/>The book is very well written. It's very dark though. I wasn't expecting that. There are a few pretty cringe worthy parts. Overall this book had a lot of potential that just fell a bit short on the execution for me. <br/><br/>I'll likely be continuing on with this series, but I probably won't be rushing out to get the next one when it comes out.",,,,,,0,,,,,

Most of what I do read tends to be about computer stuff. However video games have been an important part of my life for as long as I can remember.<br/><br/>I still consider the 16-bit generation to be one of the best. The games hold up so much better than the 32/64 bit generation that followed as 3d was being introduced. The art style is a lot more timeless and some really great games were released. It probably helps that I was 10-13 or so during this time period.<br/><br/>I was a Nintendo kid. I own every console from NES through Game Cube, plus the original Game Boy. Nintendo lost me in college as they continue to focus on kids and decided to neglect those of us who belong to the ""Nintendo Generation"".<br/><br/>This is the first book I've read on this time period. From the title, I was expecting this to talk about both sides of the ""Console Wars"" and that was my first disappointment. If I had read the blurb, I would have realized that this was mostly Sega's story. In particular, Tom Kalinske's story. He was brought in to run Sega of America and take on Nintendo.<br/><br/>It's hard to know if I was just too young for Sega at the time, or if I truly just like Nintendo better, but I never got the big deal. Give me Mario over Sonic anyday. Or really screw them both and give me a new Zelda game to play.<br/><br/>That said if not for Sega and Tom Kalinske, the video game industry would be that much poorer for it as Nintendo had a near monopoly before he showed up and turned things on their head.<br/><br/>Mr. Harris did extensive interviews to write this book, and I imagine he either got more time/better interviews from the Sega folks than the Nintendo side. You get glimpses of the inner workings of Nintendo, but most of the time you see the actions of Nintendo through the eyes of their competitors. If you were a Nintendo kid like I was, you may find yourself as disappointed with this as I was. If you're a Sega fan, you might come away differently.<br/><br/>The other big drawback of this book is the format. For some reason he decided to write the book as though he/we were present while events were happening and apparently made up a bunch of the dialogue and conversations in the book based on his interviews.<br/><br/>What this does in my opinion is bloat the book while rarely going deep on some of the key points. He could have either written a much shorter version of the same book, or given a lot more depth at the same length.<br/><br/>It does make the book very readable though. It's an easy read, and there is definitely a lot of interesting stuff in here that those of us who grew up during this time period or are simply fans of video games and their history should enjoy.<br/><br/>He touches on most of the major events: The introduction of Sonic the Hedgehog, The launch of the SNES, The Sega Scream and ad blitz, Mortal Kombat, the government hearings on violence in video games and the creation of the ESRB. Things end with the first E3, the launch of the Sega Saturn, and Sony's entry into the market with the Playstation.<br/><br/>I think if this book got more in depth and was more balanced with its inside looks at both Sega and Nintendo it would have been a much better book, but it's still a good one worth a look if you're a fan.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Not long after, the first two books of this series were on sale so I added them to the ever increasing pile. Recently, I was looking for something to read. A few people recommended this as a good light read and I'm happy to agree.<br/><br/>Aliens are among us. The conspiracy theorists are right. They've been inhabiting humans since the days of the neanderthal. Tao has inhabited some of the best leaders in history including Genghis Khan and Zhu Yuanzhang. His current host Edward is an elite field agent. <br/><br/>Then everything goes sideways and Tao ends up in an overweight 30-something computer programmer named Roen (hey that's me! well, not *that* overweight, but still!) whose life is going nowhere.<br/><br/>This is really more of a spy thriller with a sci-fi backdrop than it is your typical technology near-future sci-fi story. Roen doesn't obtain magic powers, highly advanced weapons or a jet pack.<br/><br/>What he does get is thousands of years of experience and expertise of the alien symbiote named Tao. Can Tao use his knowledge to turn Roen from overweight slob into something that can pass for a field agent? He had better because there is a civil war between the two factions of aliens that has been raging for hundreds of years, and Tao's side is losing.<br/><br/>The book is well written, with enjoyable characters. The is a decent amount of humor throughout keeping things pretty light. I really enjoyed the way Mr. Chu incorporates the Quasing into our history.<br/><br/>This book was a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to picking up the sequel just as soon as I have some more time.

I grabbed this book however because I really enjoyed the first one and was excited to see that a second book was out.<br/><br/>My favorite character in the series is probably Philip, and he seemed to get more focus in this book. This book also addressed my major criticism of the first book: Where are all the women?<br/><br/>This book sees us visit Atlantis, which was used as the explanation for why there was almost no women. I enjoyed the female characters introduced in this one, especially the Brits.<br/><br/>Time travel stories are really hard to write well as it can all be very confusing. I think Mr. Meyer does a great job of handling this by having the characters be just as confused as everyone else. They offer several theories to explain things, but seem just as unsure of the plausibility as I was. This is definitely not a hard sci-fi book.<br/><br/>The humor in this book probably wasn't as good as the first one, but that didn't make the story any less fun. I did find the parts focused on Jimmy to be less enjoyable than the stuff with Philip and Martin however.<br/><br/>Overall I think this was another great entry in this series. Almost everything was nicely wrapped up, while the epilogue planted the seeds for a possible third book. I hope he does write a third because I'll happily listen to it.

For some reason this story wasn't as much fun. It's hard to put my finger on exactly why. <br/><br/>My best guess is the pacing. For such a short book, it felt like the plot meandered too much on unimportant details. The beginning was strong. It pulled me right back in again, and I thought everything was good to go. But then it got slow in middle, and felt sort of rushed at the end. I was sort of underwhelmed by the final confrontation especially.<br/><br/>I guess since I wasn't having as much fun with the story this go around and it made the quality of the writing more noticeable. I'm not one to spend much time commenting on the writing too much. I tend to leave that for English teachers/literary types.<br/><br/>I care a lot more about story and character development than I do about how elegant the prose are. If you're entertaining me, I'm not going to notice bad sentence structure/dialogue.<br/><br/>If I had to sum this book up with one sentence it would be ""Hurog means Dragon."" Why you ask? Well because it's said at least once per chapter. Often more than once. Or at least that's how it felt. Eventually I groaned every time another character said it. <br/><br/>I wonder if the writing was just as bad in the first book and I didn't notice. ""Hurog means dragon"" was said a few times in that book as well, but it didn't seem nearly so frequent. I didn't really find the dialogue or prose that bad.<br/><br/>Glancing over other reviews it seems like I may be in the minority.

The name was familiar to me, but I wouldn't have been able to have named you any books or series by her.<br/><br/>I couldn't tell you if this is her usual style of book, but if it is, I'll definitely be interested in reading more. This doesn't seem to be as popular as some of her other series though. I found this a quick and enjoyable listen.<br/><br/>It's a play on the chosen one trope, but there is more of a focus on politics. Our protagonist has been playing stupid for years in an effort to reduce the chances his father finds him a threat and killing him.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for him, this means that his father also doesn't trust him to take over after he's gone and names his uncle to rule in his place, at least until his 21st birthday. So of course our hero sets out to make a name for himself and show his uncle that he's not really the fool he's been pretending all these years.<br/><br/>And of course he gets swept up into events bigger than himself and must rise to the occasion or see his friends, family and home suffer.<br/><br/>In a worlds where dragons are long extinct and magic is dwindling, this is more political than fantastical overall, but there is certainly enough in there to make it more than a historical fantasy.<br/><br/>This is book one of a duology, but I feel like it came to a pretty good stopping point where I don't feel I need to rush out right away to read the second book, or (given it's shorter length) like it was simply one book that was split in half.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this a fun and lighter book and I'm looking forward to listening to the conclusion soon.",,,1,,,1,2014/06/15,Review Copy,Like new,,

I don't this one is nearly as good, but I think most fans of Mr. King will find this enjoyable. <br/><br/>Most of the novels by Mr. King I read have some sense of the fantastical to them.

A decorated retired cop whose depression is suddenly shelved after being taunted by the perpetrator of one his most high profile unsolved cases.

Where this book shines (as usual) is in the characters. Mr. King always seems to write the most realistic and interesting characters. They aren't necessarily someone you'd want to hang out with or even know, but they are the type that make it hard to look away (or in this case stop listening to the book).<br/><br/>Holly and Jerome are both memorable characters to add depth to the duel between our retired detective and the killer who got away.

Before 2012 I hadn't even heard of him. Now he's one of my favorite writers and I've listened to just about everything he's written.<br/><br/>I tend to read more fantasy than sci-fi. I seem to prefer my sci-fi in TV/movie form instead. Maybe because I like lighter sci-fi, which Mr. Scalzi writes very well. I also love his snarky sense of humor which I think Wil Wheaton does well.<br/><br/>This might be my favorite book of his yet. It's not as funny as some of his others, but it's still a lot of fun. I really love the world he built with some hand wavy science fiction that is really just used to set the stage for a murder mystery. He said that he's got an idea for another book in this world if it does well, so everyone go out and buy a copy because I want him to write it!<br/><br/>Our protagonist Chris is a rookie FBI agent on their first week with one major difference. They are ""Locked-In"" to their body since childhood due to a global pandemic. Chris uses a remote controlled robot nicknamed a Threep (after C-3PO) to be present in the world due to being unable to speak or move.<br/><br/>Writing the previous paragraph was very difficult because I wanted to keep it gender neutral. Because this entire book is as far as I can tell written that way. Mr. Scalzi probably had an easier time of it than I did because 1) He's an experienced and professional writer and 2) It's written in first person. Still it's an interesting approach to a story.<br/><br/>Since I did the Wil Wheaton version (and because I'm a guy myself), I assumed Chris to be a guy, only to realize we never really know if that's true or not.<br/><br/>It goes to show that for all the emphasis on racial and gender differences it really doesn't matter when telling a good story. When your protagonist is interacting with everyone remotely with a robot what does gender or race matter? They look like a robot. Chris is a capable FBI agent because of their mind, because when you're Locked-In that's really all that matters.<br/><br/>This is another fun and quick read from a master of writing those kinds of stories.

That's a pretty common complaint in fantasy. However as this is a fantasy book based in current time and involves using computers to manipulate the world to <i>pretend</i> to be a wizard this seems like a big flaw for me.<br/><br/>Mr. Meyer has a plausible reason to explain away his lack of female characters, but he could have just as easily had a plausible reason for their inclusion instead.<br/><br/>Overall though, I really enjoyed listening to this book and I'll be on the lookout for his next book as well as planning to check out his webcomic in the near future.",,,1,,,1,,,Like new,,

Since that time I had several friends telling me I had to read it. <br/><br/>I was reluctant to do though, because the third book hasn't been published and there is no real eta in sight. I was content to wait until at least their was an announced publish date. Until last year that is, when I finally caved and read both books with a few friends. I'm glad I finally did, though now I'm stuck waiting for the final book like everyone else.<br/><br/>I seem to be in a minority of the fans I've talked to who thought that [b:The Name of the Wind|186074|The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)|Patrick Rothfuss|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1270352123s/186074.jpg|2502879] was good, but [b:The Wise Man's Fear|1215032|The Wise Man's Fear (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #2)|Patrick Rothfuss|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1297311431s/1215032.jpg|2502882] was much better. So maybe that will put me in the minority of fans once again who find myself a bit disappointed with this story.<br/><br/>Originally slated for [b:Rogues|20168816|Rogues|George R.R. Martin|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1404616147s/20168816.jpg|27565413], Mr. Rothfuss set this one aside and wrote The Lightning Tree instead. It has a similar feel to this. We follow Bast around for a day in the life. I really loved that story. I felt like we got some good insights to his character we didn't in the main novels.<br/><br/>Auri is definitely one of my favorite characters in his books, so I was really excited to see he had a novella about her coming out. Until I saw the price. I like to support authors I read so they will hopefully continue to write more stories I enjoy, but $17 for a 150 page novella seems crazy to me. So maybe I was already in a negative mindset coming into this book.<br/><br/>I was planning to wait until I could get a copy from the library and if I enjoyed it, picking up a copy for my shelves if/when the price came down. However, I was fortunate enough to receive an early review copy of the audio book, making the price irrelevant to me personally.<br/><br/>So I've written all these words now (and apparently you've kept reading them) and still really haven't talked about the book. That seems appropriate because there really isn't a story here. <br/><br/>We follow Auri around for a week. We do get some insights into her thought process. Maybe someone smarter than me will argue we get a lot of insights. Maybe if I read it again, I'll come away with more. I don't know. What I really wanted was to know more about Auri's background more so than her character. As far as I'm concerned, you get none of that here. Maybe I'm just not smart enough.<br/><br/>And that brings me to why I rounded down my rating of 3.5 to a 3. I was all set to round up to 4 because I really like [a:Patrick Rothfuss|108424|Patrick Rothfuss|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1351307341p2/108424.jpg], and I really like Auri. He seems like a generally nice guy who does a lot of great things for other people with his success and influence. <br/><br/>But Mr. Rothfuss felt the need to include this long author's note at the end. He makes it out like an apology to his fans who may not ""get"" this book, or don't like it. But to me it came off as insincere and really more like him turning up his nose at anyone who doesn't love this story as much as Vi Hart.<br/><br/>And the thing is, I didn't dislike it for any of the reasons he mentioned. This book definitely FEELS like Auri. I liked all the randomness. Auri's OCD makes me feel way better about my own. She really is a great character, and that shines through here. As I said my main disappointment was getting nothing about Auri's back story.<br/><br/>But to talk about ""There are plenty of stories out there for you, even if this one isn't"" came off condescending to me. I'm probably just reading it the wrong way, because Mr. Rothfuss never stuck me as that sort of person before now.<br/><br/>So if you want a story where nothing really of note happens and to just spend time with Auri, you'll probably love this story. If you like me were hoping for some kind of back story, you may be disappointed like I was. There definitely were a few hints dropped, but nothing that made any real sense to me, just left me with more questions than before I read it.",,,1,,,1,2014/10/15,Review Copy,Like new,,

Not quite as infamous as Kevin Mitnick, Poulsen may have been the more technically proficient of the two, and less capable as a social engineer.<br/><br/>I had heard of his two most famous hacks, that being winning not one, but two Porches from a radio give away, and supposedly crashing the the Unsolved Mysteries call in lines when his story was aired on the show. The first was confirmed and explained in detail, while the latter seemed to be glossed over for some reason. It was insinuated, but not confirmed.<br/><br/>It appears that Mr. Littman had cooperation not only from many of the people in Kevin's life, but eventually Kevin himself.

It's nice to know this story of brilliant but somewhat troubled young man has a happy ending, since the book was released shortly after his release from jail with a more abigious ending.<br/><br/>For those who may not know (though I suspect most people who pick up this book already knows who he is), Mr. Poulson has been a well known writer in the computer security and currently works for Wired. It seems to have been a long and dark journey to get there though.<br/><br/>I never knew he once had a security clearance or briefly worked for Sun Microsystems. It leaves you to wonder what he might have accomplished if he could have controlled his darker impulses.<br/><br/>The other thing that struck me was like Mitnick, they people prosecuting him felt the need to come up with bogus charges. He was guilty of all kinds of non computer crimes that they should have been able to prove, but they seemed to want to prosecute him for computer crimes he didn't commit (like espionage).<br/><br/>Overall it was a pretty fascinating read that I didn't find too technical, but may be a bit too in-depth for non-computer folks.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I read it early on as the hype was starting to build and before it won every award under the sun. I enjoyed it, and I'm not surprised it won so much, but I would have been equally unsurprised if it didn't. It's definitely one of those books that many people will read and scratch their heads at.<br/><br/>So now we come to the sequel to what is arguably the most successful (or at least the most decorated) book of last year. Will Ms. Leckie continue on her success or fall into the dreaded ""sophomore slump""? For me the answer is closer to the former, than the latter. <br/><br/>The first book gets a lot of discussion about the lack of gender. Everyone is a she. If I'm perfectly honest, I don't notice or care most of the time. I'm not sure if that's the point. To me it just feels like a gimmick though. But it really doesn't matter to me one way or the other. Someone much smarter and literary than I am can debate the implications or try to determine the gender from the context, I'll be busy reading another book. <br/><br/>One of the other gimmicky things about the first book I did really like however was the way Breq while the only viewpoint was still multiple viewpoints. I was happy to see that Ms. Leckie managed to continue that on in this book as well. I think it's a really cool idea that makes for very unique storytelling.<br/><br/>Overall though, this book felt smaller. We spend most of it on a single planet and an orbiting station. Breq is dealing with a lot of petty problems of the locals. I really wanted a book dealing more with larger problems revealed at the end of [b:Ancillary Justice|17333324|Ancillary Justice (Imperial Radch, #1)|Ann Leckie|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1397215917s/17333324.jpg|24064628], but this seemed to mostly dance around that.<br/><br/>Yet despite that, I still found it to be a page turner. I liked the characters. I continue to enjoy Breq and her(its?) take on things. Breq has a truly unique viewpoint. There are certainly times that Breq feels a little too capable and smart, but it never really bothers me.<br/><br/>So much like the first book, I rather enjoyed this book, but I'm not going to be exactly gushing over it. I think anyone who enjoyed the first, will enjoy this, and anyone who didn't won't find this be any better.",,,1,,,1,2014/10/07,Amazon,unspecified,,

It's one of my all time favorite books. It's not the best written, or the even the best story. It just hits all the right buttons for me. In fact, I reread it not to long ago and loved it just as much.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to checking out what Mr. Cline had in store for us next. Could it be as good as his first book? Of course not, or at least I'd have been shocked if it were. However it seems like many people who loved that book were not only disappointed in this book, but downright upset.<br/><br/>That wasn't the case for me. There a ton of similarities to Ready Player One and several stories, most notably the Last Starfighter and Ender's Game. Mr. Cline acknowledges that right away and makes it part of the narrative.<br/><br/>Our protagonist Zach Lightman is a high school gamer who's obsessed with the games/music/movies of the past. Gee where have I read that before? This book isn't breaking any new ground. In fact it's treading on very familiar ground.<br/><br/>I thought it started a bit slow, but once I got into it I was having a blast. That should be obvious when you see I listened to the whole thing in just two days. It's only 12 hours, but I normally average 3 hours/day. I kept finding things to do so I could keep listening.<br/><br/>Ordinarily that kind of thing would mean a 5 star book for me, but while this book is fun, it's just not as good as others. It hits many of the same buttons as Ready Player One, just not as hard I guess. That doesn't make me mad or disappointed though.<br/><br/>I'll probably give it another listen down the road though. The door for a sequel seems to have been left open, so maybe I'll listen to it again at that point.<br/><br/>Not need to rush out and grab this one, but if you get it on sale, or need a light quick read, it's worth a look in my opinion.",,,1,,,1,2015/07/16,,unspecified,,

I think most people's enjoyment will rely heavily on how much you enjoy the humor or not however. <br/><br/><b>Audio book:</b> There are some books where the audio makes it even better. This is definitely one of those. I've never heard of R.C. Bray before this, but I definitely will be more inclined to listen to anything else he reads from now on.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I'm always more of a sword than a laser. I tend to watch sci-fi and  stick to fantasy for reading. Most of the sci-fi books I do enjoy are more space fantasy or space opera types. I'm not really into hard sci-fi despite having a science and math background. It just feels too much like work I guess.<br/><br/>So I hadn't really planned on reading this book despite all the hype it's been getting lately. Thankfully <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword & Laser</a> decided to make this their May pick, because I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I've seen it described as MacGuyver in Space and that seems really fitting. Mark Watney is an engineer and a Botanist. He's good at problem solving and fixing things. That probably a good thing as he finds himself left behind on Mars with both limited supplies and food.<br/><br/>The story takes the form of log entries, leaving the reader to wonder if Mark made it through his ordeal or if we're simply listening to the record of his final days recovered at some later date.<br/><br/>The book is a bit formulaic:<br/><br/>1. Evaluate Problem for possible solutions.<br/>2. Fix Problem<br/>3. Make humorous remarks about the Problem.<br/>4. Discover what new Problem crops up as a result.<br/>5. Repeat.<br/><br/>This may sound boring to some folks, but it just worked for me. It really helped that just as I was starting to think this he started interspersing Mark's log entries with events of the people at NASA back on Earth as they are trying to do all they can to recover Mark alive.<br/><br/>I think that anyone who don't find the jokes as funny as I did (laughing uncontrollably a few times while cleaning dishes in the break room or riding my bike), may grow tired of the story.<br/><br/>The science seems pretty good to me. However that's not something I normally care much about. As long as it seems mostly reasonable I don't give it much thought. I'm sure there are things that are wrong or could be nitpicked by people who know better than me.<br/><br/>Also anyone looking for case study of isolation and desperation that results from being left behind on Mars will be disappointed. I can't say that I spent much time thinking ""Mark's mental state doesn't seem realistic to me."" People who say that may probably be right. <br/><br/>However, astronauts are chosen not only for their skill-set and physical fitness, but mental fitness as well. I tend to make jokes when I'm stressed. Mark makes a lot of jokes. To me that seems fitting for someone between being super busy just trying to stay alive. Your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>I for one really enjoyed this book and it's put me in a total sci-fi mood for both TV and in my choice of audiobooks. I'll be eagerly awaiting for Mr. Weir's next novel as this was an excellent debut.",,,1,,,1,2014/05/03,Audible,Brand new,,

I really wish he'd stop trying. It wasn't nearly as forced or as groan worthy as some of his other books, but it did leave me rolling my eyes more than it had me laughing.<br/><br/>I have a hard time deciding exactly why I didn't like this as much as the past novels. I was always excited to pick it back up and listen, but I found my attention wandering at times. I think if I had to pick any one thing, it was all the religion stuff. <br/><br/>Normally I find mythology fascinating. Mr. Sanderson rewards the long time and careful readers with references back to past events and characters from the original trilogy. While I find the evolution of fact into myth and religion itself quite interesting, the frequent talk of it wore on me a little.<br/><br/>Overall though, this is a fun book with some great action that always shines when Mr. Sanderson uses the magic system he built in new and unique ways. I'm interested in seeing how its use continues to evolve as the technology does as well.<br/><br/>This book seems to do a good job of setting up the trilogy without feeling like it just stops.

If you a fan of the first one/Mr. Sanderson and don't do audio, it's still probably worth picking up if the price is right.<br/><br/>I hope we get a third story at some point in the future, and I won't complain if Audible wants to give me that one for free as well. ^_^",,,1,,,1,2014/12/03,Audible,Like new,,

The End. I'm told the sound effects and the music are normal for Star Wars books. It seems well done here and not overused/distracting. Marc Thompson is an awesome narrator. He does voices for all the characters, including Chewbacca. What's better than reading about a singing Wookie? Hearing it! <br/><br/>His Han Solo does remind me a bit of Peter Griffin for some reason, but overall it reminds me more of Harrison Ford's performance. His voices for Hunter Maas is probably my favorite.

I like Star Trek just as much as if not more than Star Wars (<b>*ducks*</b>). I love the original trilogy (4-6) and I don't really care for the prequel trilogy. Jar Jar can go die in a fire. And this is my very first Star Wars book.<br/><br/>So why start here? My friend loves Star Wars books. I think he's read most of them. He's been telling me to read them for years. Shouldn't I have read Thrawn Trilogy by now at least? I guess so, but there are just so many other books to get to.<br/><br/>For me the final push was the author. I just did the Expanse books earlier this year and I really like [a:James S.A. Corey|4192148|James S.A. Corey|https://www.goodreads.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-d9f6a4a5badfda0f69e70cc94d962125.png]. The other thing is that despite this being book 2 of a series. It's really just a stand alone as far as I can tell. It's easy to just read this without committing myself to reading more books.<br/><br/>What you have here is a short and interesting tale focused around Han Solo and Chewbacca with smaller appearances of some of the others (Luke, Leia, R2D2, C3PO). So if you're looking for light saber battles and the force, you probably want to pick another book (just don't ask me which one).<br/><br/>There isn't some real deep plot or major revelations here. There can't be really. The book is set between episode 4 and 5. You know that none of the main characters are ever in real danger of dying because they are around in episode 5. Original characters are fair game though.<br/><br/>The original characters (or at least ones I've never heard of before) are all pretty good. The other main character of this is Scarlet Hark a rebel spy who needs extraction from the center of imperial space. And guess who has to go get her? I also particularly enjoy Hunter Maas.<br/><br/>The real winner here is the dialogue though. Maybe it has extra pop for me since I listened to it rather than reading it, but they seem to really capture the mannerisms of the characters that I remember and love from the movies. Han especially. The interactions between him and Leia are really good. There is even a ""Han Shot First"" joke in there.<br/><br/>So if your a Star Wars noob like me, should you start here? I'm not sure. It seemed to work for me though and now I'm excited to check out some more books later this year. Even if you're a bigger fan, I think there is a lot to like here, especially if you go the audio book route.",,,1,,Tom Schreck,0,,,,,

I found the emperor's kids to be annoying, and often incompetent. Just less so. I think Gwenna's chapters/story was far more interesting and enjoyable. In particular both Kayden and Adele had parts I found slowed the overall story, and left me eager to get back to other subplots.<br/><br/>Gwenna's story meanwhile, showed excellent development as the series went on, especially in this book. Her path from interesting secondary character to favorite POV character was definitely the highlight for me. I think I might have liked this series more if focused more (or entirely) on Gwenna's journey, and the Kettral. There are just a lot of other subplots in this book that felt slow or seemed to bog down the overall story. <br/><br/>It was as though Mr. Staveley was trying a bit too hard to cram an epic fantasy's world building into a trilogy. I did find some of the politics and theology compelling, just not as much as the idea of an elite fighting force who rode on the backs of monstrous birds.<br/><br/>There was a point in time when I couldn't seem to get enough dark fantasy. All of my favorite books a few years ago fell into that category. Eventually I reached a tipping point though, and started to look for lighter fare. This series is definitely a lot darker than most of the things I've read the last few years. Things get so bleak that I reached a point where I was wondering what exactly I was rooting for at the end. That's a bit too much for me.<br/><br/>Yet despite that, I found it hard to stop listening. I always did want to know what came next. I think that this book does a good job of bringing the conflicts setup in the previous books to a good conclusion.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an enjoyable series despite my complaints. I'll be eager to see what Mr. Staveley has in store for us next.",,,1,,,1,2016/04/07,Audible,Like new,,

His performance is such that this series remains a must audio for me, even if it means waiting a bit longer to get my hands on the next book.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>So I gave this book the same rating as [b:The Emperor's Blades|17910124|The Emperor's Blades (Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne, #1)|Brian Staveley|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1369246817s/17910124.jpg|25095579], and I think in many ways it's better. But I also had higher expectations coming in. I had none for the first book, and found myself pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>So I was looking forward to this. And since I got a review copy that was coming via USPS (twice), I had to wait an extra month to get my hands on it. That further built the anticipation as I watched friends who I had recommended the first one read and highly rate it.<br/><br/>This book started off slow. With how the last one ended, I guess I was sort of expecting the book to hit the ground running. The last book is largely the ""magic school"" trope, although there isn't a whole lot of magic. But there is rigorous training and rivalries and the like. And some of the characters can do magic.<br/><br/>So maybe my love of that trope, or the fact that they were ""in training"" made me less aware of just how STUPID The Emperor's kids are. There was no hiding that here. I'm not a big fan of the super smart, super capable protagonist who can't seem to do any wrong. But I hate the I'm going to pull a plan out of my ass and somehow things will work out mostly right in the end protagonist even worse.<br/><br/>It'd be bad enough if one of them did. But all three of them did. And continued to do it. They didn't learn from their mistakes. They didn't really seem to grow as characters. They just kept being idiots. And selfish. It got pretty frustrating.<br/><br/>So why did I give this 4 stars? Well two reasons mainly. One the story is interesting. The world building Mr. Stavely does in this book is especially intriguing. The pieces he put in place in this novel look to make for a really interesting third (and final?) book in this series.<br/><br/>Secondly he has some great supporting characters. Some are returning from the first novel, and some are new. In particular I really enjoyed the POV chapters from a former supporting character who was given a chance to shine. They were easily my favorite chapters in the book. I only wish they had started sooner. Maybe even in the last book, but it wouldn't have made too much sense, so I understand the reasoning.<br/><br/>So overall this book is better, but with higher expectations, I found myself a bit disappointed at the same time. But I'm looking forward to the next book. I think for a middle book there is a lot to like.  Hopefully the Emperor's kids will get a clue by then.",,,1,,,1,2015/02/18,Review Copy,Like new,,

I can only really weigh in with the thoughts of a 30-something fantasy fan.<br/><br/>I thought the book has a strong protagonist that hopefully kids could identify with. Someone whose smart, strong willed and adventurous (albeit reluctantly at first).<br/><br/>I like the choice of a female protagonist. Fantasy is overrun by young male chosen one stories, so it's always a nice change of pace to have a female. <br/><br/>The book follows the apprentice mage trope pretty much, but with a pretty unique magic system that seems well thought out. Being a middle grade book, the rules of the system aren't very flushed out, but that's OK. We learn as our protagonist learns, and I figure more details will become clear as the series goes on.<br/><br/>I also like the choice of setting. It seems to be the early to mid 1900's based on the level of technology. This has a good fit to the story being told.<br/><br/>The story was mostly fun and kept me wanting to turn pages. It probably also helped that as a ""Middle Grade"" book I flew through the pages easily finishing the book in only a few hours. The ending was a pretty good stopping place that left me wanting to know what would happen next and about the world and magic system Mr. Wexler introduced.<br/><br/>While I don't plan to check out other ""Middle Grade"" books in the future, I will at least check out the  next book in this series when it comes out. It seems to me like one of those series you could read with your kids and enjoy right along side them.",,,1,,,1,2016/04/29,Amazon,Brand new,,

Now whenever I try a new Urban Fantasy series I find myself wishing I was simply rereading the Dresden Files.<br/><br/>I always get people telling me, if you like Dresden you'll like <i>insert series name here</i>. They just never hold up. I usually find myself bored after one book or two. <br/><br/>This one wasn't amazing or anything, but I didn't find myself thinking too much about Dresden while I was listening to it. It somehow seemed to be it's own thing, and not just another Dresden clone, despite the fact that is is another detective magician series.<br/><br/>I suspect if I had the first clue about London, this book would easily be 4 stars. There are probably lots of subtleties that just went over my head. But Mr. Aaronvitch seems to not only bring the city of London alive, but makes it an integral part of the story itself.<br/><br/>The original title for this book is Rivers of London, and it's very fitting. I don't really get why they changed the title for the US. I guess I can see where the new title came from, but it seems far less appropriate than the original.<br/><br/>It's probably because I love the whole magic school/apprentice thing. Peter Grant isn't exactly a young boy who is clueless, but he has a lot to learn and I always find myself enjoying learning about a new world through the eyes of a student.<br/><br/>It also helped its cause with me by not being focused on Vampires, Werewolves or Zombies. I'm pretty sick of all those things. I don't mind them being in the mix, but I hope future books don't focus on them too much.<br/><br/>I'm most interested in the unique aspects of the world building. I want to learn more about the Rivers and how seemingly ordinary people can be come powerful enough to be worshiped like gods.<br/><br/>I hope he continues to focus on that with future books as well as adding in some other unique ideas to set this series apart from the overabundance of uninteresting Urban Fantasy that just doesn't seem to do anything for me. If he does, I may have finally found another Urban Fantasy series I enjoy.",,,1,,,1,2015/03/30,Audible,Like new,,

Not only is his normal reading voice clear and easy to understand, but he does a variety of voices and accents. His reading definitely added a little extra something to the book. As a first time author, Mr. Staveley lucked out to get such a quality reader. I plan to continue this series in audio as a result.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I'm not sure what in the description made me choose this book to review. Maybe it was simply the fact that it was the first in a series. Since doing so I've seen a bit of buzz about this book, so I was eager to get my hands on my review copy.<br/><br/>This being the first book of a new series, there is a lot of character development and world building to get through. For the most part I think Mr. Staveley does a good job of this, especially as a first time author. However it does suffer from a few slower parts and some predictable twists.<br/><br/>His characters are interesting and have depth. The lore of his world is intriguing. The prologue seems confusing at first, but later on the reader discovers its significance, so just tuck it away for future reference.<br/><br/>For the most part this is the story of two brothers. They just happen to be sons of the Emperor of the largest nation in the world. First there is Kaden, the heir to the throne who is studying with the monks of the Blank God in an isolated monastery. Then there is Valyn, who is training with the Kettral, an elite military force made up of the best of the best.<br/><br/>Both suffer a bit from some of the fantasy school tropes. Valyn especially has his small group of friends and his rival with his group of cronies. However this being a military training facility, things are a lot more serious than bullying in the hallways.<br/><br/>We also get a few chapters with their sister, Adare, who has remained with their father in the capital. These are short, but politically charged. I hope we see a more prominent role from her in the books that follow.<br/><br/>This highlights the main flaw of this book. Like many fantasy books, the women are mostly relegated to secondary characters. They suffer a bit from stereotypes, but I think he does have some strong female characters that just don't receive as much focus as I'd like. In general, the secondary characters are all pretty interesting and have enough depth so as not to be interchangeable. <br/><br/>Each brother's story starts off in very different places but eventually converge with one another at the end. Things really pick up when they do. Strange things are happening around both brothers and they appear to be linked to a conspiracy to kill the emperor and his family. This makes for a lot of politics and conspiracy theories.<br/><br/>One of biggest concerns when reading books in a series is how the author chooses to end it. You need to strike a good balance between leaving the reader wanting more and wrapping up the main conflicts of the book. I think Mr. Staveley does a great job here and I'm looking forward to jumping right into book 2 when it comes out.",,,1,,,1,,,Like new,,

The other disappointing thing for me was the general lack of humor that I greatly enjoyed in his other books.

However since I love those books, I really wanted to check out some of their other writing.<br/><br/>I got this one on a daily deal earlier this year, and with the fourth book out this month, I decided to give it a go.<br/><br/>The setting for this is one where magic has almost passed from the world. The dragons that once ruled are gone. Leaving 13 races and many ruins in their wake, but little in the way of record or magic. Normally I prefer books with cool magic systems, but there is a lot to like here that I didn't mind their not being any mages throwing fireballs around.<br/><br/>Most of the book follows 4 POV characters, with a 5th used in the prologue and a 6th one added near the end. Of the main ones we have Gedar, Marcus, Cithrin and Dawson.<br/><br/>Gedar is a young and mostly foolish noble, whose ideas come from books rather than experience who is out on his first campaign. Marcus is a season veteran of much renown with a troubled past. Cithrin is a young ward of a bank, who is smart and capable despite her lack of experience of the larger world and Dawson is a powerful noble whose sense of honor only extends to those with the right blood.<br/><br/>They make for a good mix of characters, each having things I like and dislike about them. These aren't perfect characters by any means, and it's sometimes hard to know who to root for when their positions oppose one another.<br/><br/>This book is a lot more about politics and economics than it is about big battles or magic. Most SFF books tend to gloss over the economics most of all, even if they are focused on the politics. The two pretty much go hand in hand and often money is relegated to not having enough and taxes. This books focuses on banking and the roles the banks play in the politics of the nations. The banks are independent and only care about making a profit and not about who is at war with whom. <br/><br/>There are 1 or 2 points where I wish I could have skimmed over some details about costs and things in the book, but for the most part I found it really interesting and important to the story. Economists would probably be disappointed, but compared to most other fantasy books I've read this covers things far more thoroughly.<br/><br/>This book has a lot of grey areas without really ever getting into dark fantasy. Do you root for the noble who wants to protect his kingdom and king from chaos, but regards farmers and other commoners as little better than dogs? Do you root for the kindly noble who may mean well, but is often ignorant or spiteful in his actions?<br/><br/>I will say that this book had a point where I saw where the plot was going and thought it would keep following a predictable path only to throw me for a complete loop.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this book and look forward to continuing on with the series when I have a chance.",,,1,,,1,2014/02/10,,Like new,,

Who knows though, maybe he’ll grow on me.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>This is a hard review for me to write. I spent a good portion of it annoyed at the book. That would make it sound like I didn't like it, but that’s not the case.<br/><br/>I've always been more of a Star Trek fan than dystopian sci-fi fan. When it comes to Space Opera, I like politics and war at a higher level. Large factions feuding over planets and ideals.<br/><br/>For me the first three books really sort of fell more into this. This book however felt much lower level. The politics of the first three books serve as the basis for things. There has always been discrimination between the belters and the inner planets, but never has it been so central to the conflict as in this book.<br/><br/>That may appeal to some reasons, for me it mostly made me uncomfortable and mad. Not at the book or the authors, but the characters. I think most authors would be happy to evoke strong emotions in their readers, but for me personally I generally don’t like to spend my recreation time angry.<br/><br/>As seems to be par for the course, we get a bunch of brand new POV characters this go around, save for James Holden. Two of them are minor characters from previous novels. First there is Havelock, who was Miller’s Earther partner in [b:Leviathan Wakes|8855321|Leviathan Wakes (Expanse, #1)|James S.A.

Corey|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1317402997s/12591698.jpg|17606541]. This is rounded out by an Elvi, a human scientist.<br/><br/>I didn’t like any of them, especially Elvi. I think she is the weakest female character they’ve written yet. I still wish they'd bring back Bobbie and Avasarala (thankfully there looks to be potential for this in book 5). I loved them so much that everyone else seem to disappoint me. I felt Anna in [b:Abaddon's Gate|16131032|Abaddon's Gate (Expanse, #3)|James S.A.

Elvi was another step in the wrong direction for me as well.<br/><br/>So you have a bunch of characters you don't really like in what to me felts like a side story for most of the book. They do stupid and hateful things to one another. I know the types of people portrayed in this book exist in the world. Maybe they once existed in greater numbers. Maybe I’m just sheltered or fortunate not to run into these kinds of people on a regular basis.<br/><br/>The whole thing just made no sense to me. Everyone’s actions were stupid. I was especially bothered that many of the Engineers were the worst. Most of the engineers I know are very logical and well thought out in their actions. Sure there are exceptions to that, but this seemed to flip that on their head.<br/><br/>I despised Murtry, head of the Earther's security and all around asshole. I'm pretty sure that was the point. The problem was I didn't feel like I had anything to root for. I spent most of the book wishing Holden and his crew would just leave and go do something else that was related to the protomolecule and the developments from [b:Abaddon's Gate|16131032|Abaddon's Gate (Expanse, #3)|James S.A.

Discrimination and pointless violence. Spending way too much time and energy trying to kill one another when there are far larger problems to worry about.<br/><br/>Despite this, I ended up enjoying the book. I found it hard to turn off when it was time to stop listening. I’m still not sure how they pulled that off. Eventually I did find myself liking Havelock and Basia more though. Elvi still felt like she was there to serve at a 4th ""camera"" most of the time. She was important to the plot, but I just never grew attached to her I guess.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the final quarter of the book a lot more than the first three. We eventually get some development of things with the protomolecule, though not as much as I would have preferred. I just really enjoy spending time with the crew of the Rocinante, no matter what’s going on.<br/><br/>With the announcement of 3 more books, I worry things will be drawn out too much. Personally I’d like the protomolecule story arc to get wrapped up by book 6, and have the three new books be a completely new story arc. Time will tell what happens. Either way I’ll be eagerly picking up book 5 when it comes out.<br/>",,,1,,,1,2014/06/17,Audible,Like new,,

However, as a fantasy fan I can certainly appreciate and enjoy what is here.<br/><br/>The story moves along at a pretty good pace for most of the book, but does slow down a bit in the last third or so.<br/><br/>My only other complaint is less a complaint more than a puzzlement. Ms. Le Guin decided to break from the norm and have most of her characters be people of color. Yet she has almost no women, and the ones that are there are thin stereotypes. It doesn't ruin the book by any means, but as a female author it is a bit surprising to me.<br/><br/>Overall I found this enjoyable, and now I need to find time to read the rest of the series.<br/><br/><br/>3.5 Stars rounded up because I really enjoyed most of it.",,,1,,,1,,Amazon,Very good,,

There seem to be three main story lines, but a bunch of smaller ones.<br/><br/>Edeard's started a little slow, but probably was my favorite by the end.

He's a fine narrator, but nothing special. He speaks clearly and at a good volum. This is one of those books that's fine in audio, but not a must listen. I'll likely continue the series in audio simply because it's the type of book that works well for me in that format.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>Myke Cole has been a guest on Sword & Laser a few times now. He seems like a cool guy, and I've really wanted to check his books out. I've had this ebook for awhile, but haven't gotten around to it. Since it was a cheap upgrade to get the audio, I decided to go that route.<br/><br/>I haven't read much military fantasy. This is certainly the only modern military fantasy I've read. I think the main reason I enjoyed this book is because at it's core, it's a magic school trope. Magic boot camp really, but close enough. I can't get enough of it. <br/><br/>My main issue was I found the protagonist (and the majority of the characters really) unlikeable. I'm not sure if that was Mr. Cole's intention or not. He definitely seemed to be going for a grey portrayal where who's right and who's wrong isn't always clear. The only characters I found likeable throughout were Marty and Terez.<br/><br/>I have no experience with military culture outside of fiction. Myke Cole does. I'm going to assume he does a good job with that. The lingo and some of the personalities seemed to line up with my expectations. It reinforces my long held thought that I have no business in the military, and makes me appreciate those who serve all the more. I certainly couldn't cut it.<br/><br/>The book was a bit darker than I'd hoped for. I guess that's probably bad expectations on my part. It probably relates back to my general dislike of the protagonist. I understand his struggles with what the right thing to do is, but his selfishness and often times lack of remorse were extremely off putting.<br/><br/>This book brings up a lot of political issues relevant to debates in the US over the actions of the government on personal freedoms, discrimination, use of force, military contractors and in general how to act in an increasingly grey area that is the war on terror. Who are the bad guys here? Do the ends justify the means? I feel like Mr. Cole does a good job in presenting both sides of many of these issues that often left me unsure who/what I was rooting for.<br/><br/>Overall, the concept of military squads of magicians is a cool one, and the magic bootcamp plotline kept me really interested even when I struggled with some of the characters. The book felt fairly self-contained to me, despite being the first book of a trilogy. I think I could stop here and be content. Not that I plan to. I'm looking forward to checking out the next book in this series sometime soon.",,,1,,,1,2015/12/01,Audible,Like new,,

I’m not sure if he exclusively reads books targeted at an Australian audience, but if so that's a shame. <br/><br/>He does a good amount of voices for the various characters and his normal reading voice is clear and easy to understand. Some of his voices are grating, but I think that's fitting with the characters he's portraying. Maybe this partnership between Bolinda and Random House will bring more of his work to the US. I'd like to see what he does with a better book.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>The start of this book was promising, but things went off the rails. Then, just as they seemed to be recovering, I found the end to be awful. <br/><br/>I think my main problem this book is the characters and their dialogue. In part one of the book Mr. Irvine introduces us to several characters that I despised almost immediately. In part two he seems to be trying to elicit sympathy from the reader via self-pity from internal monologue and sympathetic back story. It might work for some readers, but not for me. At best instead of coming around to like the characters as complex and flawed, I find myself mostly indifferent about what might happen to them.<br/><br/>The main character is mostly likable, although some of her thoughts rubbed me the wrong way. I assume this is another attempt to give her depth through flaws instead of being a hero trope.<br/><br/>Maybe my dislike of almost all the characters is just an inability for me to understand their society, but I doubt it. The most likable characters are minor ones who don't seem to stick around very long. It's really hard for me to enjoy a book when I don't like the people I'm reading about.<br/><br/>The main story is interesting to me though. The world is at war with much more powerful alien creatures. Humanity have built machines called clankers in order to be able to fight back, but they are still mostly outmatched. <br/><br/>At first this seems more like sci-fi than fantasy, but the clankers are powered by crystals and there a mostly unexplained magical system based on them and their connection to power nodes around the world. So really it's some sort of mix that has more of a fantasy feel than sci-fi to me personally.<br/><br/>There are a lot of political and social issues that play into things. With so many young men dying in a seemingly endless war, everyone is expected to produce children to essentially provide the next generation of fodder. Anyone accused of a crime is sent to one of two places depending on their gender. Males are sent to the front lines where they will likely die in short order. Women are sent to ""breeding factories"" which are exactly what they sound like. <br/><br/>Entirely too much time  was spent on the breeding factories, and the notion of a society so desperate to survive they force women to sleep numerous partners in the hopes of producing the most helpful offspring as frequently as possible is downright horrifying to me. <br/><br/>This is apparently the second series of Mr. Irvine's Three Worlds sequence. Having never read the first (The Mirror Quartet), I'm sure I'm missing some references to things from that series. My understanding is this is set hundreds of years later, and possibly on a different world. I never felt lost but it’s possible I would understand more about the crystals and their powers if I had read that series first.<br/><br/>Overall it wasn't a very good book that wasn't as well executed as I'd like. I found myself cringing at some of the writing in places, especially the dialogue. I may still continue on with the second book of the series largely because I already have a review copy, but I need to take a break with another book first. The ending of the book really was really off-putting though. It felt like a bad TV Soap Opera.<br/>",,,1,,,1,,,Like new,,

While I enjoyed both, these series seem to be very different.<br/><br/>Apart from the prologue the first half of this book contained almost no magic at all. There is pretty much just a lot of military protocol and character development. <br/><br/>I'm not a big reader of military fiction in any form, but it is one of the aspects of Malazan Book of the Fallen I'm really enjoying. Unlike that series however there are no medics who use magic to heal or mages who attack with spells here. There are simply soldiers with muskets, bayonets and swords.<br/><br/>I think anyone who finds well described military action boring may be turned away by this one. It really is sort of slice of life with military men for a good portion as Mr. Wexler builds the world and his characters out for the reader.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first half of the story at a solid 3-3.5 rating, but when the fantasy element of this book did finally come along it really raised things to another level for me.<br/><br/>We are provided with two primary point of views that of Captain Marcus d’Ivoire and a soldier named Winter Ihernglass. I liked this contrast between things at the command of the unit and things down at the grunt level.<br/><br/>I think Mr. Wexler also does a good job of swapping between the two while keeping the story flowing, especially in the later chapters where we get both POVs instead of just one of them.<br/><br/>We do get some POVs from the opposing forces in this book, but they are mostly relegated to the prologue, interludes and epilogue. I would have liked to see more from the opposing characters as for now their motivations are vague at best.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure who I'm rooting for in this series. I'm not sure if the goals of the Vordanai and their new commander Colonel Janus bet Vhalnich Mieran are for the best. <br/><br/>I think that's part of the charm of this book. Most fantasy these days operate in shades of grey, but since we're not given much in the way of opposing viewpoints the reader is left to draw their own conclusions about who (if anyone) is in the right here.<br/><br/>Things really pick up at the end and this book comes to a satisfying conclusion while setting things up nicely for the next book, which I'm now looking forward to.",,,1,,Alex Ristea,0,,,,,

Mr. Sullivan knows how good he is too, and made it a point to get him on board for the audio book before even selling his book rights. He does not disappoint here, and I'll once again proclaim that audio is the best way to go for Mr. Sullivan's fantasy series.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I'm always stingy with my five star ratings, but this was an easy choice. The start is a bit slow, but I was far from bored. There was a lot to setup with the start of a new series, even one in an already established world, but it was done quite well as usual.<br/><br/>Mr. Sullivan's books have become my go to recommendation the last few years, because I rarely feel so good while/after reading a book. He seems to always strike the right balance between tension and fun. I know I can pick up his books without worry about constant bloodbaths, backstabbing and despicable characters. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy darker fantasy as well, but it's nice to read something on the lighter side.<br/><br/>I've been looking forward to picking this series up since first learning about it a few years back. I love his Riyria books largely due to the characters he's created. What would a series set in the same world but 3000 years in the past hold in store?<br/><br/>The answer should be unsurprising to fans of his work. Mr. Sullivan has once again created a cast of excellent characters who I can't help but love. Since I did the audio you'll have to forgive any misspellings on my part. Hands down my favorite of the bunch was Suri, whose bafflement of ""the game"" everyone plays of stating obvious things is only part of the reason she's so endearing.<br/><br/>A close second is probably Persephone. She's smart and capable, and cares a great deal about her village and its inhabitants. It's also nice to get the perspective of at least one of the Fhrey with Arion. So unlike many fantasy books that seem to relegate women to minor or unimportant characters, all of my favorites here are women.<br/><br/>Then there are Raithe and Malcolm, who make for a nearly as amusing pair as Royce and Hadrian. However not quite THAT good. And that doesn't get into all the excellent secondary and tertiary characters. Persephone's village is full of very interesting people who I look forward to seeing again in future novels.<br/><br/>All and all this book does a great job of setting up the story and introducing us to an excellent characters without ever feeling boring or full of info-dumps. It's also fairly well self-contained despite being the start of what looks to be a six book series. Things come to a good stopping place, while leaving your eager for what will come next.

If not for it being the November <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword & Laser</a> pick, I may not have read it. I would have been missing out.<br/><br/>This one was slow to grab me. The protagonist does not have one point of view but many. How you ask? Well it's a sentient ship made up of hundreds of mobile units referred to as Ancillaries. Just what is an ancillary exactly? It's not exactly clear at the start so, you'll have to read to find out.<br/><br/>I'm not very well read in Sci-Fi, so I don't know if this concept of Ancillaries is new or derivative of previous works, but it felt very unique to me. It was hard to get accustomed to at first. <br/><br/>The sudden swap of perspectives on the same scene can be quite jarring and confusing. As I'm only a solitary unit, and not a shared collective I don't think well that way.<br/><br/>I don't recall if this is the first time I've read a book with an artificial intelligence as the protagonist, but the fact that I can't certainly shows it's something unusual for me. I think Ms. Lackie does a good job with it. It certainly doesn't feel human to me, but that doesn't make it uninteresting.<br/><br/>I don't tend to spend a lot of time thinking about the books I'm reading while I'm reading them. I've seen/read far to many Movies/TV/Books over the years that when I do, it can ruin the experience for me. I tend to just ""sit back and enjoy the ride"" as it were and saving the thinking for when I'm done. This one was hard to do that though. There was a lot going on, I couldn't help but wonder and theorize.<br/><br/>My only real complaint about this one is it takes too long for you to know what exactly is going on. The story alternates chapters between past and present until meeting somewhere in the middle and you finally have things click into place. I can see this turning people away from the book and missing out.<br/><br/>There are just too many books out there competing for everyone's attention and it's too easy to put down something that doesn't grab you right away. Overall though, I really enjoyed this one and will be waiting for the next book in the series to come out.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I've been fortunate enough to exchange several emails and discussion posts with Mr. Sullivan over the last few months after discovering his Riyria books late last year.<br/><br/>Fortunate may not be the best word since Mr. Sullivan seems to go out of his way to interact with his fans. I hate writing reviews for books I don't like to begin with, so the notion of writing a review for an author I've actually talked with a bit was weighing on the back of my mind as I set down to read this book. Thankfully I really enjoyed the book, so none of that matters. <br/><br/>The book was a bit slow to start. Ellis Rogers is an unhappy man living in the present day who receives a terminal illness prognosis. Medical technology just isn't ready to solve his illness yet. His solution is to finally use the time machine he's been building in his garage to travel to a time when he can receive the treatment he needs.<br/><br/>So if read that setup as I wrote it, I'd probably not be too interested in reading the book. Thankfully this isn't a book that spends much time dwelling on whether someone (even an MIT graduate) could build a working time machine in his garage in 2014, or any of the other technological advances written about in this book for that matter. If that sort of hard science fiction is what you're looking for, you're going to be disappointed here.<br/><br/>What this book is about really is the nature of humanity. Politics, Religion, and especially love. You know, the stuff you're not really supposed to talk about in many social settings? For this reason alone I think many people may not enjoy this book. Especially those with more conservative leanings.<br/><br/>From my personal experience, most humans are social creatures. Why else would something like Facebook be so popular? They crave attention. Some more than others, but most people seem to need it to at least some degree. People want to be loved. Whether it is the platonic love of friends, the familial love of blood relatives, or romantic love of that special someone. It is our relationships with others that make life worth living.<br/><br/>The other major aspect of this book is what is happiness? Is Mr. Sullivan's Hollow World a utopia? A dystopia? Somewhere in between? A world where there is no more crime, war or disease. No more hunger? No more greed? Does that sound wonderful to you, or downright boring? Maybe a little of both? He also explores what it means to be human and unique. Are genetically engineered genderless clones still human?<br/><br/>I think this makes for both a great and divisive discussion book. Mr. Sullivan does a good job at presenting some of the different arguments, and leaves it to the reader to decide. For me personally I think that nothing is so black and white. The antagonist of this book makes some really good points. He also has some really awful ideas.<br/><br/>I hope that most of his Riyria fans will enjoy this one, but I suspect that won't always be case. I spent a lot more time thinking about the ideas in the book rather than just enjoying the ride. It's not the type of book I'd want to read on a regular basis, but one that I find enjoyable from time to time.",,,1,,,1,2014/03/11,http://riyria.blogspot.com/p/store.html,unspecified,,

Taniel is sort of suffering a kind of PTSD that makes him less likable than the first book. His story is still interesting though, and I found this change of character very understandable.<br/><br/>A big change for this book is that instead of having multiple POVs telling part of the same story, the characters are each involved in their own thing which aren't so tightly related. In fact the main characters don't really interact at all.<br/><br/>To me this built a sense of a much larger world than the first book. Things weren't so narrowly focused. You got to see things outside of Andro as well as inside of it.<br/><br/>My only real complaint here is once again the lack of strong women characters. Oh sure they exist in the world, but they are mostly minor characters. Ka-poel is probably my favorite, but she seems relegated to side-kick. Maybe if the mystery surrounding her character was removed by internal dialogue, I wouldn't feel the same though.

It's one of those rare occasions for me where I watched the TV show before reading the book. Apparently a lot of fans of the books don't like the show, but I enjoyed it. It motivated me to finally pick up the book.<br/><br/>As is usually the case, the book is better. It seems as though the show decided to cut down the first 2/3 of this book into a single episode. Likely because they didn't want to have to find/use a child lead for half the season. I think Ragnar's story suffers a bit as a result. I found that fascinating to read.<br/><br/>It also seems like they either added a bunch of stuff, or more likely used parts of book 2 at the end of the season. I wasn't really surprised by anything since I knew what was coming, but I still enjoyed it. I likely would have enjoyed it a bit more had I read the book first. I didn't realize until about halfway into the season that it was based on books I already owned/had on my to read shelf. Oops.<br/><br/>The writing is good, and the characters are interesting. I know almost nothing about English history, so it's hard to know what's truth and what Mr. Cornwell made up. It comes off very realistic to me though. <br/><br/>I've always enjoyed history, and I must really enjoy this time period, because I've read a boatload of fantasy based on it. This one feels a bit fantastical at times with the various gods and superstitions of both the Danes and the English.<br/><br/>Overall, I found it a fast and enjoyable read. I definitely plan to continue on with the series soon (which is good since I own most of it already).",,,,,,1,2015/04/25,Amazon,unspecified,,

Sullivan|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1375570227s/16043804.jpg|21821161], I was convinced it's better to read <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/series/96465-the-riyria-revelations"">Riyria Revelations</a> first. With this entry I'm a bit torn.<br/><br/>The major plot points were immediately apparent to me fairly early on. Why? Well I had heard about them before as background during the Revelations series. There are some major details that will likely escape readers starting with Chronicles first, or at best be unconfirmed suspicions that won't be confirmed until they read Revelations however. This adds some depth to the story that might otherwise be missing.<br/><br/>So how does a ""predictable"" book get a 4 star rating? Well I really love Mr. Sullivan's characters for one, and it's great to get to spend more time with them. Not only are Royce, Hadrian and Gwen back, but we get to see Arista, Aldric and the Pickerings as kids in this one. Not to mention everyone's ""favorite"" grandfatherly character, Bishop Saldor.<br/><br/>Mr. Sullivan once again promotes a minor character from the original series to a POV in the prequel series. This time it's Hillfred, who himself is a boy just on the verge of becoming a palace guard. That detail alone should give veteran Riyria readers an idea of many of the major plot points of this book.<br/><br/>Like [b:The Crown Tower|16043804|The Crown Tower (The Riyria Chronicles #1)|Michael J. Sullivan|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1375570227s/16043804.jpg|21821161], we get a much darker Royce who hasn't been tempered by 15 years in Hadrian's company. Maybe it's my grimdark fandom that leads me to somehow enjoy this version of Royce even more than I did during Revelations. Still this book is far from the grit and gruesomeness of Abercrombie or Martin, despite possibly being the darkest book of the series.<br/><br/>A problem with prequels is you know when something bad happening is inevitable, because it already has. You can only sit back and wait for it.<br/><br/>Like [b:The Crown Tower|16043804|The Crown Tower (The Riyria Chronicles #1)|Michael J.

He avoids major spoilers with clever dialogue that will have Revelations readers shaking their heads knowingly that first time readers will likely miss completely.<br/><br/>I for one hope that he will continue writing these Riyria stories as I'm already sad to have burned through all 8 stories so quickly.",,,1,Riyria Fans,,1,2013/10/19,Audible,Like new,,

Fitz just didn't sound right to me. Same thing with Molly. Bee seemed fine, but really she sounded almost like Molly.

I loved [b:Fool's Fate|45108|Fool's Fate (Tawny Man, #3)|Robin Hobb|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1388181998s/45108.jpg|2960725] (<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/404258538"">My Review</a>). I've enjoyed all of Ms. Hobb's books but that's the only one I've given 5 stars too. I was just so satisfied with how it ended. Sure there were questions, but all the big things were resolved.<br/><br/>So would this book ruin my favorite book? Well not yet, but it certainly hasn't alleviated my fears that the events of this trilogy won't tarnish things for me.<br/><br/>Like many books by Ms. Hobb, things start out slow. I don't mean that in a negative way however. Somehow she is able to write in such a way that I don't mind the day to day life of her books. Despite my trepidation, it just felt nice to be back with characters I love. If you're looking for a lot of action or a flashy start, you'll be disappointed. I imagine that anyone picking up this book is already going to be a Robin Hobb fan and used to her style though.<br/><br/>More than anything, Ms. Hobb's writing is able to evoke strong emotions in me as I read. Love, anger, happiness, frustration. Few other authors can make me despise a new character so quickly or completely. Similarly Fitz continues to frustrate me with the way he does things in a way that is just all too human. Often times the protagonist in a fantasy book faces external adversity and rises to the occasion. Meanwhile Fitz is frequently his own worst enemy. Poor Ms. Hobb loves putting him through the ringer too, and this book is no different.<br/><br/>I had three issues with this book costing it that fifth. The first one I suspect many long-time Hobb fans will share. The other two may largely depend on the reader.<br/><br/>The series is called Fitz & Fool. The book is called Fool's Assassin. So why did it take so long for us to see the Fool? Sure he's mentioned often enough, but I want to spend time with him just as I am spending time with Fitz. So far this series seems a lot more like Farseer than Tawny Man in that regard.<br/><br/>The second thing was the addition of a POV besides Fitz. I guess I'm a very jealous reader. I originally hoped it was a one off thing early in the book, but when it turned out to be a regular thing it bothered me. I felt robbed of time I could be spending with Fitz. By the end of the book it grew on me and I came to look forward to those chapters nearly as much as I did the Fitz ones.<br/><br/>The final issue I had was the ending. I know this is the first book of a trilogy, but I hate cliffhanger type endings, and this one seemed pretty bad to me. If you're the type of person who hates waiting for the next book, you may be better off waiting until the final book is either published or has a release date. It's going to a be a LONG wait for me until book 2.<br/><br/>Overall I really liked, but didn't love this book. I'm still pretty nervous about what may happen next. I think that above all shows how great a writer Ms. Hobb is to fill me with both a sense of anticipation and dread for the next book in the series.",,,1,,,1,2014/08/05,Review Copy,Like new,,

Could Mr. Sanderson save this series from the disappointing place he left me with the last book?<br/><br/>The answer is a bit mixed. I think overall I liked this book a little more than the last one, but not nearly as much as [b:Steelheart|17182126|Steelheart (Reckoners, #1)|Brandon Sanderson|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1357576738s/17182126.jpg|21366540]. The ending was partially satisfying, but felt very rushed. Too much time was spent moving characters around and on a new subplot introduced in the last book. The big/final villain was nowhere to be seen for far too long. Some new ideas were introduced right at the end with little to no explanation. Plus one of the interesting new characters  was introduced and then gone without ever coming back to them.<br/><br/>And that doesn't even get to the protagonist. David went from relatable/likable in the first book, to annoying in second, and downright obnoxious in this one. I never liked the bad metaphor gag. I've long felt Mr. Sanderson doesn't do humor well. He's apparently worse at intentionally bad jokes. I took to skipping every metaphor I could as the book went on.<br/><br/>Overall, while I liked the idea of super powers turning people into super villains and the ""magic"" of their powers, the execution fell short for me. It's far from his best world building. I don't read much Young Adult. It's demographic that seems to be largely all over the place and hard to truly define. I think from now on I may avoid it entirely. <br/><br/>I'll certainly be avoiding any of Mr. Sanderson's non-Cosmere books for the foreseeable future. He's either finally starting to show some cracks from his incredible output, or my tastes are staring to move beyond him. I certainly hope not though.

I don't think this book was nearly as good. Mr. Sanderson cranks out books like no other author in Fantasy, and I think that's starting to show a bit here.

This book did start slow, and had me worried a bit, but once it got going it was really enjoyable and makes for a great addition to the series.<br/><br/>Mr. Sullivan says he made it a point to allow readers to choose their entry point, and I think he makes a good effort at it. I had a friend read this book first and he enjoyed it and wasn't confused.<br/><br/>However, try as he will there are some things I'd consider spoilers in this book, which is pretty much inevitable with a prequel. They may only be minor things and I tend to be overly sensitive about that kind of thing. Either way I think you'll get more out of this book having read the original series first. There are definitely some subtleties and backstory that will missed by someone who starts with this book instead of [b:The Crown Conspiracy|4345290|The Crown Conspiracy (The Riyria Revelations, #1)|Michael J. Sullivan|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1313141264s/4345290.jpg|21574260]<br/><br/>So on to the book. There are two main POVs for most of this book: Hadrian and <s>Royce</s> Gwen? I was a bit surprised about the Gwen story as I didn't know much coming in. The start of her story is a large part of why I found the start of this book slow. It was worth it in the end however. <br/><br/>Once her story got going I found it really interesting, and made for a nice contrast from Hadrian's story which was almost entirely devoid of woman. Gwen was an interesting minor character in the original series, and it's fun to see her promoted here.<br/><br/>Hadrian's story starts a bit slow as well, but not as much and I did enjoy the character of Pickles a lot. Overall the book really doesn't get going until Royce and Hadrian are together though.<br/><br/>Coming fresh from [b:Percepliquis|12174312|Percepliquis (The Riyria Revelations, #6)|Michael J. Sullivan|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1312541516s/12174312.jpg|17145858], there had been a fair bit of mention of the ""Crown Tower job"" and I think Mr. Sullivan does a good job of fleshing that out into a full story here.<br/><br/>The book finishes a lot stronger than it starts, and I made it a point to get some extra listening time in on the last day to make sure I'd finish.<br/><br/>As a prequel, this really adds more detail to the back-stories of Royce, Hadrian and Gwen, and adds a lot of depth to the characters. Royce especially. <br/><br/>I'm looking forward to reading about other past adventures of the Riyira pair.

I was really getting fed up with her character. For someone so smart, she tends to always find herself in trouble. I guess that's supposed to be due to being noble-born and therefore naive about the ways of the world.<br/><br/>I really thought I wasn't going to like this story, but things turned out differently.<br/><br/>Finally in this book, Arista becomes much more likable. Away from the comforts she was used to, instead of whining and complaining, she adapts. <br/><br/>This has easily been my favorite of the series thus far. Not only has Arista developed but we're introduced to another great character in Emelia. Once a simple kitchen worker, she finds herself suddenly in the middle of plotting and politics.<br/><br/>And of course Royce and Hadrian are back. We get some great insights into the backstory of both.<br/><br/>Mr. Sullivan seems to have a knack for writing good episodic stories that build on the overarching story. Things are wrapped up nicely while still leaving you wanting to continue on in the series.<br/><br/>4.5 Stars.<br/><br/><i><b>The Emerald Storm</b></i><br/><br/>This one started kind of slow, especially after how much I enjoyed the last one, but the second half was much better.<br/><br/>I could have done without the pity party and the ""I'm retired"" bit, because we all know Royce and Hadrian are going to instrumental to the rest of the series at this point.<br/><br/>So it turns out the Emerald Storm is a ship, but the story ended up taking a much different turn than I expected. I figured there was going be a lot more pirates and high sea action, but the real story was more about the crew of the ship itself.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the supporting cast in this book more than probably the previous three. There are a lot of shady characters, and some down right despicable ones that add a lot to story.<br/><br/>There is a lot more setup in this story than the rest, and the path to the finale seems clear now.<br/><br/>4 Stars.",,,,,,0,,,,,

It was really hard to stop listening. In fact I went out of my way to find reasons to keep listening. That’s always the sign of a good book.<br/><br/>In this story we have the majority of the characters that have been spread out throughout the world all in one place on the verge of Wintertide.

The situation Hadrian finds himself in seems a bit ridiculous, but I don’t care as it made for some really great storytelling.<br/><br/>Mr. Sullivan seems to have really come into his own both in writing and his grasp of all the details of the world and characters he created.<br/><br/>My only small complaint is one that most authors and fantasy fans wouldn't mind. With the previous four stories, they each felt complete and come to a reasonable conclusion. You want to read what’s next, but I found it easy to pause between stories to read other things. <br/><br/>Not so with this book.

The sights, sounds and smells of this book just seep from the pages. I don't have the best imagination when reading, but it was impossible not to be swept up in the imagery here.<br/><br/>This is one of those books more about the journey than the destination. I knew I'd like this book regardless of how it ended. I loved the circus as a kid, but I've never experienced one as magical as this one. I wish such a thing existed.<br/><br/>I liked Bailey's story more than the main one for some reason. The whole competition made for some excellent things that made me want to visit the circus even more, but did little to endear either of the competitors to me very much. I also really liked the Rêveurs. I thought it was a great ode to fandom of all kinds in a way that felt natural and obvious in the scope of the book.<br/><br/>I'm not really a fan of ""hand wavy"" magic systems that aren't well developed or explained. However in this case, it's a good fit. It's a book where you want to just be swept up in the atmosphere and not worry too much about the details.<br/><br/>I have a few minor complaints that prevent me from giving this a 5 star rating, but they really aren't worth getting into.

I can't say I have (or will) read the other nominees from that year, but this one was a lot of fun for me.<br/><br/>It's more thriller or detective novel than sci-fi. A lot of older works I've read are more focused on some cool sci-fi idea and less so on the story. This one was the opposite.

This book has only despicable characters.<br/><br/>First, we have the protagonist, a former mercenary bent of revenge.<br/><br/>Then we're got her assortment of ""friends"":<br/><br/>- A 'master' poisoner and his assistant<br/><br/>- A Northern Barbarian whose best skill is killing.<br/><br/>- A serial killer with an obsession for numbers. Rain Man he's not.<br/><br/>- Another mercenary whose loyalties are fluid based on whose paying the most.<br/><br/>- And a ""retired"" torturer<br/><br/>You know it's a bad sign when the most likable character is probably the serial killer.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean the characters are badly written. They are certainly quite entertaining too. Nicomo Cosca is especially amusing. But with no one really being likable to me, I wasn't sure what/who I was routing for by the end.<br/><br/>That sort of makes it a weird book to me. Typically even if the main character is ""bad"" they have some redeeming qualities or something to make them into a sort of anti-hero.<br/><br/>Monzcarro Murcatto may have had some redeeming qualities once, but now she is bitter and angry and won't let anything stand in the way of her revenge.<br/><br/>I think Mr. Abercrombie does do a good job in taking some minor characters from the first series and promoting them to larger roles in this stand alone novel. I think this also ties thing together nicely with the First Law trilogy without really spoiling things much.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend reading First Law BEFORE tackling this book. Sure it's stand alone, but there is a lot of context and references you'll miss if you haven't read that first.<br/><br/>As a fantasy book, this was pretty light on the fantasy. It could almost have been an alternate history book if it weren't set in Mr. Abercrombie's First Law universe. <br/><br/>At its heart this is a revenge story. Monzo is determined to make the ones who wronged her pay. It makes for a fun romp full of unexpected consequences and lots of action. <br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed it.

She is part of the meandering in places I was referring too though.<br/><br/>Logan's development is probably the most interesting, and at times the most disturbing. His time in ""Hell's Asshole"" still makes me cringe.<br/><br/>This book seems heavily influenced by the Wheel of Time. First we have the Aes Sedai wandering around and we meet the Brown who is more focused on  her scholarship than anything else.<br/><br/>Then the <s>Children of Light</s> show up (I can't remember their actual name, or find it on the damn wiki), with their roving army of Mage Haters.

Not that I recommend it, because that book was also enjoyable.<br/><br/>Most reviews I've read seem to indicate this is the best of the series. I found my enjoyment to be about the same. If anything distinguishes the two it's that this one doesn't focus on a male whose righting wrongs with his sword, but a woman who is doing it with her wits (and some help from the gods).<br/><br/>I think this is one of those books you need to be in the right mood for. It's not a fast-paced, action packed sword and sorcery story. It's also not a politically charged struggle for power. Often times it seems that when strong woman are portrayed in fantasy, they are politically savvy nobility maneuvering for power.<br/><br/>Instead we have a woman who decides she needs a journey. Not for adventure. Not for glory. Simply because she needs a break. Royina Ista has spent most of her life under a family curse or control of someone else. She just needs to get away. This doesn't seem to make sense to anyone else, so she does so under the guise of making a religious pilgrimage to pray for her daughter to have a grandson.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for her (and fortunately the reader), the gods have other plans. Royina Ista is confronted with raiding soldiers, demons, sorcerers and a plot that threatens the safety of all of Chalion. There is a bit a of romance thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>All and all this is a well written and enjoyable fantasy story that is quite different from just about everything I read.",,,1,,,1,2014/03/15,Audible,Like new,,

While I probably enjoy Dagger & Coin more, I still found this to be quite good.<br/><br/>Since I'm doing this in audio, I struggled badly with the names though. Probably worse than usual. I still really don't know any of the character's names. I wish every audiobook came with a list of character names and their spellings. It would make both my reading and my review writing far easier.<br/><br/>Much like Dagger & Coin, this is pretty much a low fantasy series. There is almost no magic to speak of. One of the characters, Seedless, is a magical construct called an Andat who is a conduit for magic of a practicer who is referred to as a poet. You don't really see much of the magic, and it's not really explained. How exactly the poets are able to do anything isn't clear. It seems to be a struggle of wills with the andat they control.<br/><br/>Mr. Abraham likes focusing on the politics of his fictitious worlds, and this is no different. He has built a world where much of one's emotions and dilogue is actually done through a series of complex hand gestures. It's a society that relies of the power of the poets and condones fratricide among the sons of the rulers as a means of succession.<br/><br/>Young sons are often relegated off to the school that is responsible for cultivating the next generation of poets to save them from being murdered. So you'll never guess who are protagonist it? You guessed it, he's a younger son of one of the city rulers. Go figure.<br/><br/>Overall I found both the world building and the characters to be pretty good/memorable, though less so than his other series. It's going to be hard for me to talk about the characters by name though, since I couldn't tell you what any of them are. I think all the main characters offered depth where no one really felt good or evil. They are just people with desires and faults trying to do what they feel they must for a variety of reasons: values, outside pressures, self interest, fear, etc. I like that sort of characterization. <br/><br/>My favorite character is probably the older 50-something overseer. I wish more SFF novels did this. Abraham seems to have at least one of them in all of his series I've read, and they've all been great. While this one is no Avasarala or even Clara, she is still pretty memorable. Now if only I could tell you her name. :(<br/><br/>The pacing is also a bit slower, especially coming from one of his Expanse books. I don't think it's that much slower than Dagger & Coin.<br/><br/>This pacing, and the general lack of action and fighting may turn some fantasy fans away. If you're looking for military battles, and sword wielding adventurers, you've come to the wrong place.<br/><br/>I however seem to enjoy the more political fantasy novels, so the pacing was never an issue for me. I jumped right into book 2, and will likely finish this whole series pretty quickly.",,,1,,,1,2015/06/10,Audible,Like new,,

It would be right at home with all the Dark Fantasy that seems to be abundant these days. This book is way more gruesome in places than most of the so-called ""grimdark"" fantasy I've read recently. This seems to be a book that has gone under the radar of most fantasy fans.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of those man's man kind of books. Caine is a total badass who kills first and doesn't even bother asking questions later. I can imagine a lot of grunting and snarling as I read along.<br/><br/>The female characters are rather thin. They are badass too, but they also bombshells. You won't find a Brienne of Tarth, or Arya Stark here.<br/><br/>If you don't read the description before starting the book, you'll likely be a little taken aback when an assassin in a fantasy novel starts making references to CRTs and Elmer Fudd. It's not bad writing/editing though.<br/><br/>This is really the story of two worlds. A futuristic dystopian Earth, and a fantastical world full of magic called Overworld. Somehow humanity has found a way to send people to Overwold all while allowing the super rich to virtually ""ride along"".<br/><br/>It is the most popular form of entertainment for the privileged class. Watching lower class ""Actors"" fight, kill and often times die for their entertainment. This is no simulation. These are real people who are dying. The ultimate in bloodsport experience.<br/><br/>This is what makes really made the book for me. The parallels between the two worlds, and how the politics and caste system of Earth's impact on the politics of Overworld.<br/><br/>This is no simple revenge story, but one with political undertones. Similarly Caine is no simple thug, but the smart and calculating Hari Michaelson.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed it. The story feels pretty self contained, so while there are other books, I don't feel a need to rush out and read the next one.<br/><br/>It got a little slow in places though. Mr. Stover doesn't seem to write the politics as well as he does gruesome violence and action sequences. That cost it the extra star, but I will definitely be continuing on the series at some point. I'd highly recommend it to any Dark Fantasy fans who like me had never heard of this series/author.",,,1,Fans of Dark Fantasy,,1,2014/02/06,Amazon,Very good,,

I think that's why so many enjoyable movies have been made from them. However, his storytelling just never seems to engage me.<br/><br/>I like the concept of an alternate history of where Allies lost World War 2 and the US is occupied by both Germany and Japan. Even better is the alternate history book inside of this book positing what might have happened had the Allies won. Very Meta. One has to wonder if Inception was inspired by this story within the story idea, though I'm sure this probably isn't the first or only instance of such a thing.<br/><br/>I found most of the characters fairly uninteresting, and the main plot sort of a vehicle for wandering around this alternate world.

Despite that I found them to be enjoyable. Like settling into something comfortable and familiar. In the ever increasing abundance of grimdark fantasy, this serves as a nice break.<br/><br/><b>Audio book:</b> I listened to this in audio after getting a good deal on it through Audible. I was quickly sold on finishing the series in audiobook. <br/><br/>This is the first book I've listened to by Tim Gerald Reynolds. I found him to be an excellent reader. Not only is he clear and easy to understand, he seems to have a variety of voices that greatly increased my enjoyment of the book. <br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/><br/>Since this is an omnibus, I'm going to opt to review each story individually.<br/><br/><i><b>The Crown Conspiracy</b></i><br/><br/>The first story is a bit uneven. We meet thieves Royce Melborn and Hadrian Blackwater, who work under the name of Riyria. Royce is the prototype rogue while Hadrian the oft underestimated fighter. Mr. Sullivan does give them both a great amount of depth and had me greatly liking them by the end of the book.<br/><br/>During the course of the book, we meet a bumbling monk, an arrogant prince, a mysterious wizard, and a treacherous dwarf. The story is a bit lacking on female characters. The princess Arista is a bit interesting, but the focus isn't really on her. We also get the ""prostitute with a heart of gold"" who is just a minor character.<br/><br/>I found this story a bit uneven. There were some slow and predictable parts that seemed to just write themselves. However there was also some twists and turns that kept me guessing a little bit.<br/><br/>The pair take a job that leads them on an unexpected journey that turns them from thieves to reluctant heroes. There is a good mix of action that gets a bit dark, but nothing like you see in most grimdark these days. So if you're looking for another gritty ""realistic"" fantasy series, look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Overall this was a fun story and a good first effort from Mr. Sullivan. I probably liked it more than someone looking for something new and original might. It's the type of story I enjoy, especially taking a break from darker novels.<br/><br/>3.5 Stars.<br/><br/><i><b>Avempartha</b></i><br/><br/>This was the better of the two stories. There are a few slower parts early on, but once the story really got going, it was hard to stop listening.<br/><br/>We gets some insights into both Royce and Hadrian's past. There is some resolution to lingering story lines from the previous story, as well as a humorous nod to it.<br/><br/>We also get some insights into the mysterious wizard and the treacherous dwarf.<br/><br/>Princess Arista has a larger role in this book, although I find her a bit unlikable. Maybe that's simply due to her being raised a spoiled princess. I do think her heart is mostly in the right place even if she comes off like a spoiled brat in places.<br/><br/>The best addition to the cast was the farmer's daughter Thrace, who is the naive farmer's daughter with an abundance of courage. Again a bit tropey, but very likable and it's nice to have another female character at least.<br/><br/>The conspiracies introduced in the first story are explored further and <br/>we get some more insights on the larger scale.<br/><br/>Riyria has been sought out by Thrace at the prompting of an old acquaintance to help her father obtain a magical sword to defeat an evil beast that is plaguing her small village.<br/><br/>I'm most intrigued by the elves, who have always been my favorite fantasy element, who like many other books are elusive. We still don't meet any full-blooded elves, but we do get to experience some of their architecture. I hope we'll get to see something from them soon, maybe in the form of a strong female elf.<br/><br/>I thought this was a lot less predictable than the first story, and really enjoyed the character development of our two protagonists. There is some nice setup for the next books that has me eager to continue on in the series. Not only that, but Mr. Sullivan does a good job of developing many of his supporting characters as well.<br/><br/>This again isn't a story that will appeal to grimdark fans as it's more of a light fantasy where despite the dangers things work out for the best. Mostly.<br/><br/>4 stars. ",,,,,,0,,,,,

It's not always a winner, but you never know until you give it a shot.<br/><br/>Now that I've finished, I feel like the whole zombie thing is overblown. That might disappoint the zombie fans out there, but for me it was a good development.

I've always thought it was just an excuse to wear top hats, goggles or a monocle.<br/><br/>The story has 2 main POVs, Brier and her son Zeke. The book is full of several strong and interesting female characters in fact, which is always a pleasant development in genre fiction.<br/><br/>Zeke runs off to the walled off part of the city full of poison gas, zombies and dangerous people. Brier chases after in an effort to save her son from peril. <br/><br/>Add in a mad scientist, crazy contraptions, airships, pirates, and other shady characters and you've got a pretty fun and light read that had me eager to see what would happen next.<br/><br/>I hope to find time to read other books by Ms. Priest, and has me more interested in giving other steampunk books a shot in the future.",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

I enjoy a dumb action flick every now and again and I don't even mind popcorn fiction, but this just didn't seem to click with me. I'm still not sure if it's that I simply don't like the book that much, or if I just wasn't in the right mood for it.<br/><br/>There are cool action sequences. I liked some of the sci-fi elements (transferred consciousness, virtual reality) and how they were incorporated into the storyline. I was interested in finding out the reason for the murder/suicide.

This book has a lot of point of view characters and starts with a lot of stories that appear to have nothing to do with each other...at first. It made me think I was reading an epic fantasy novel where technology replaces magic and aliens replace elves and dragons.<br/><br/>There is a ton of sci-fi concepts in here: memory/life backups, cloning, anti-aging/near immortality, worm holes, FTL. I'm probably missing some minor ones, but those are the biggies.<br/><br/>It's a world where space exploration is boring because wormholes make travel between planets instantaneous, and the idea of spending money on ships and sending them to the far reaches of space to explore is considered a waste.<br/><br/>That is until a mysterious event occurs on the edge of space prompts the need for the first space ship in centuries to be constructed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile you have a terrorist, a murder investigation and a whole lot of politics to contend with. It's a society that doesn't seem very far off from out own, save for the technological advances.<br/><br/>Mr. Hamilton does a great job at character development. And he makes you think about things. What would you do if you lived for multiple centuries, getting a youthful body every few decades or so as you needed (assuming you can afford it)? Would you stay married to the same person? Would you keep the same job?<br/><br/>My favorite characters/story lines was the main storyline with Wilson Kime the one time NASA pilot and now captain of the new constructed Second Chance.<br/><br/>The other I enjoyed most was probably Paula Myo and her investigations into both a murder and the case that eluded for over a hundred years involving a terrorist named Adam Elvin. She's not someone I could see myself being friends with (I'm not sure she has any anyways), but I can identify with several of her character traits.<br/><br/>My only (mostly minor) complaints are that some scenes go on too long (30 minutes of hang gliding, seriously?), and the way this book ends by setting up several cliff hangers.<br/><br/>I knew this was part of a series coming in, but I think the ending could have been better.<br/><br/>Overall though, a very enjoyable book and I'm looking forward to finishing the series with [b:Judas Unchained|45244|Judas Unchained (Commonwealth Saga, #2)|Peter F.

After reading [a:Peter F. Hamilton|25375|Peter F. Hamilton|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1235123752p2/25375.jpg]'s Commonwealth Saga, I had several people telling me I should really check out this series.<br/><br/>As it happens, audible had a big sci-fi book sale, and I was able to pick this one up, so the timing seemed perfect. Unfortunately, this book didn't live up to expectations.<br/><br/>It's not bad, and I'd consider reading another Reynolds book in the future, just not anytime soon. I found it really confusing at the start. I'm not sure if that's entirely the story's fault (it sort of feels like he means for you to be confused) or the fact that I did it in audio, but I'm not a big fan of stories where the author tries to confuse you.<br/><br/>Eventually though I got my bearings, and there was some cool stuff going on that I wanted to find out more about. However, I found all of his characters unlikable. I prefer character-driven stories. Great characters can carry a weak story a lot better than weak characters can carry a great story for me.<br/><br/>That isn't to say Mr. Hamilton's characters are weak or undeveloped. I just didn't like them. The worst thing an author can do for me is make me not care what happens to the characters. I didn't exactly hate his characters either. If I did, at least I could have rooted for them to meet some sticky end. No, mostly I found myself indifferent.<br/><br/>To me this is a book that had a lot of potential that just failed in execution for me. Other people may like the characters more, or maybe aren't as put off by reading a book where you don't feel like you have someone/thing to cheer for. <br/><br/>Maybe I'll try one of his stand alone's next, but for now I need a break not only from Mr. Reynolds, but Sci-Fi in general.",,,1,,,1,2014/05/04,Audible,Like new,,

Sci-Fi that is smart, plausible, and not overly dystopian. And it's well written, with interesting and well developed characters. It's hard to believe it's a debut novel.<br/><br/>This is one of those books that I kept thinking about even when I wasn't reading it. The ideas here are so thought provoking.<br/><br/>I've wanted to have the internet in my head for at least 15 years. Maybe longer. Instant access to all the information in the world? I mean smart phones are great and all, but the interface is clunky. Just think it and bam. Programming your brain? Where do I sign up?<br/><br/>Except.. Opening yourself up to cyber viruses, brain hacking, or even just internet trolls? Frightening. <br/><br/>Everything here is pretty grey. Is Nexus OS good? Is it bad? It seems to have both positive and negative potential. Some of those in favor of it appear to have the best of intentions. Yet at the same time, some of those opposed to it, do as well. Whose right? Should the government block certain research and technologies for good of it's citizens?<br/><br/>And at the core of it all, Nexus is a drug. I've never been a drug user. I don't think I've even been drunk in over 10 years. So the idea of needing drugs is a big turn off to me personally. My main disappointment in this book is the general lack of consequences of the technology.<br/><br/>I don't mean the possible bad things that someone can do to you/your brain. What does Nexus do to your brain? Is it addictive? What are the long term effects of constant use? Hopefully these things will be explored in the later novels.<br/><br/>Apart from that though, this book was really great. I was always eager to pick it back up. I've already jumped right into the second book and have blown through it pretty quickly.<br/><br/>If you want a smart, well written, thought provoking sci-fi novel, definitely give this book a try.",,,1,,,1,2015/04/19,Audible,Like new,,

I don't know how to properly express my feelings about this book.<br/><br/>It's not exactly a sci-fi book. Except it is. There isn't a lot of technical detail, so it's certainly not hard sci-fi. It's a first contact story. But really it's a story people, relationships, and trauma. That's not a spoiler. Ms. Russell lays that out right at the beginning.<br/><br/>The book alternates between present day and flash back chapters. We know something awful happened, but we don't know what that is.<br/><br/>It's well written, and the characters are excellent. It's also depressing as hell. My favorite parts were the flash backs on earth with Anne and George. Some of the parts were hard to read though. <br/><br/>I thought the religion thing was pretty well done. It doesn't cover all the bases, but you've got some Jesuits, a Jew, and some atheists. This isn't a religious book. It's a book with people of faith in it. I'm not one who enjoys reading religious stuff, and I wasn't bothered by it. So if it's not your thing either, I wouldn't let the fact that protagonist is a Jesuit turn you away.<br/><br/>I can't really speak to how religious people view this book, but I don't think it's an anti-religion book either. It simply talks about the faith of it's characters in a pretty neutral manner.<br/><br/>Early on in the book, I had a good idea what had happened. I just didn't know the details. In some ways I didn't want to know the details. I would have preferred to read more about Emilio before his trip.<br/><br/>Being prepared for it didn't really help though. I think that makes this a book that some people will just love, while others will find hard to read.

I was not much of a fan. The writing was excellent, but the characters and the plot didn't do much for me.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how to categorize this. Is it sci-fi? Is it fantasy? It is cyberpunk? It has elements of all three, but doesn't exactly fit into any one of them neatly.<br/><br/>This isn't a dystopian story. It's a near future one where computers have enabled in depth virtual reality. It has a very cyberpunk feel at times. Maybe it's post cyberpunk? Then within the virtual reality, we experience many traditional fantasy settings and characters. So it's really a blending of the three.<br/><br/>Regardless of the exact genre, the world hits all of my buttons. I'm a sucker for VR stories. If you mix in fantasy like this does, all the better.<br/><br/>The story took me a bit to get into at first. It's very well written, but there are several subplots, and it took a long time for it to become clear just how they related to each other. This book is very largely a setup book. Much of it seems involve moving characters into the right place and setting up the world.<br/><br/>The characters are pretty well developed and diverse. We have a VR specialist from South Africa named Irene ""Renie"" Sulaweyo and her student a Kalahari Bushman named !Xabbu. There are also the more traditional protagonists in Paul Jonas and Orlando Gardiner. <br/><br/>I found Renie and !Xabbu refreshing as characters, but for me the large draw was the world building and the mystery of the Golden City.

However this collection has 3 stories that were converted into movies I enjoyed, especially Shawshank.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Stephen King, though I've read very little of his horror novels. He's often relegated to a horror writer, but this collection shows what I feel is his real strength: writing great characters. <br/><br/>There is very little horror to speak of here, save for some of the awful things humans do to one another, though little of it occurs in great detail.<br/><br/>Next to Dark Tower, Shawshank might possibly be the best thing he's ever written, though of course everyone will have favorites of their own.<br/><br/>This is a really good collection, that is definitely worth picking up, whether you're a fan of King's other work or not.<br/><br/><b><u>Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption</u></b><br/>I don't know what to say about this one really. It's a prison story, but that's just the setting.<br/><br/>Really it's a story about strength and determination in the face of adversity. A lot of adversity. Andy Dufresne is a case study in making the best of a bad situation.<br/><br/>But really nothing I write will do this story justice. Read it. And watch the movie. The movie is excellent. Easily the best adaptation of any of King's work.<br/><br/>4.5 stars<br/><br/><b><u>Apt Pupil</u></b><br/>This one is just too dark for me. I could only read it a little at a time. Then I'd have to watch something funny and light as a palate cleanser.<br/><br/>For fans of King's horror work, this one might be the most in that vein. However there are no evil clowns or demons here. It's just terrible people doing terrible things.<br/><br/>The story and the writing is quite good, it's just generally not the sort of story I enjoy reading. I know I watched the movie at some point, but don't really remember it. Unlike the others in this book, I don't plan to revisit the movie in the future though.<br/><br/>3.5 stars<br/><br/><b><u>The Body</u></b><br/>My second favorite story of the collection. I remember seeing part of this movie what I was younger (probably too young to see the movie). The swimming scene has stuck with me all this time.<br/><br/>Reading the story made me appreciate the movie even more. The casting is so perfect. Maybe it colored my perception of the characters as I read it, but I think it's more a testament to the whoever cast the movie.<br/><br/>My only real complaint about the story, was the nested stories written by Gordie. The pie eating contest story was alright, but I can't even remember what the second story was about. That goes to show how unimportant it was to the overall plot.<br/><br/>I never had anything remotely close to the experiences of these four boys growing up, but that doesn't make it feel any less real to me. It's been long enough since I've seen the movie that I didn't really remember what happened.<br/><br/>Much like Shawshank, I'm hard pressed for what to say other than: read it, and watch the movie.<br/><br/>4 stars.<br/><br/><b><u>The Breathing Method</u></b><br/>The weakest of the four stories, and maybe unsurprisingly the only one NOT to be made into a movie.<br/><br/>In fact I'm far more intrigued by the setting of the story, this mysterious club with books not found anywhere else. Old men gather to share strange and interesting stories.<br/><br/>The main story was certainly strange and interesting, but far less than the setting. As a big fan of the Dark Tower, it had me wondering if these books were from other levels of the tower. I kept looking around for Charlie the Choo Choo or something by Claudia y Inez Bachman.<br/><br/>I'd be very interested in reading a story that gives you more details about the club.

Despite the supernatural setting, the real horror of the book is perpetrated by characters on one another.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I've long since given up on reading every Stephen King book. But I try to read the ones with Dark Tower ties. This one was supposed to have minor connections, but I'd call them easter eggs at best.<br/><br/>What really moved this one up my list was the TV show. I enjoy the show, though if was a Fall show rather than a Summer one, it's possible I would have dropped it already. My main reason for reading the book was to find out the mystery behind the dome before the show revealed it. I needn't have worried though.<br/><br/>Like just about everything else though, the book is better. Not only is it better, it's almost entirely different. The plot seems to diverge from almost the very beginning. Some of the characters are similar, and they used some of the names. Most of them are drastically different though, or severely toned down.<br/><br/>No one will watch the show and think the Rennie's are likable characters by any means, but they have some redeemable characteristics. In the book both of them are downright awful. And they are not the only ones.<br/><br/>Mr. King's strength as a writer to me has always been his characters. They jump off the page. This book has some great ones. Though his best characters here are probably the worst. <br/><br/>Jim Rennie, used car salesman, town selectman, and fervent Christian is absolutely despicable. His ability to do something downright awful and follow it up with prayers for strength to continue to lead the town just show how self delusional some people can really be. And his son is probably worse. Most of the town is behind the Rennie's, or at least willing to blindly follow their lead in this time of crisis.<br/><br/>Thankfully though, there are plenty of likable characters, which will be somewhat similar to anyone familiar with the show. Primarily Dale Barbara, a drifter currently employed as a short order cook at the local diner. And there is Julia Shumway, the owner/editor of the local newspaper. They are rounded out <br/><br/>If you pick this book expecting a supernatural horror story, you may be disappointed. Mr. King doesn't spend a lot of time explaining the how or why of the dome. It mostly serves as the setting and a bit of plot vehicle. The characters want to escape, or use the dome as the reason to do something they might not otherwise.<br/><br/>Forget the fact that there is giant supernatural dome for a minute. The core of this story is really about all the horrible things people will do to one another when given an opportunity to get away with it, or simply not face real consequences.<br/><br/>Mr. King paints a picture of the best and the worst (mostly the worst) of humanity when panic and isolation and puts them under the microscope (or a dome!) for us to see the results.<br/><br/>I'm having a hard time trying to figure out other King book I've read this is most like to say ""if you like <i>book name</i>, you'll probably like this one.""

It seems like the Overlook Hotel might be competing with The Crimson King's Low Men for Danny. He'd probably be a hell of a breaker.<br/><br/>I'm not much of a horror fan, but Mr. King is one of my favorite authors. Why? Well most of what I've read by him tends to overlap into the fantastical. This one is no different. The book centers around the evil Overlook Hotel, which is very much so a character in it's own right (or more accurately, several characters). <br/><br/>I'm intrigued by the history of the hotel. There have been a series of dark events that have been mostly covered up by the ownership and the management. Are the owners purposefully helping the hotel to continue to claim new victims? It kind of seems that way.<br/><br/>The other reason I love Mr. King's books is his characters. I didn't really like any of the Torrance family. Jack is an alcoholic with anger issues, Wendy is neurotic, and Danny is kind of creepy. If you watch the movie, you might think that's all there is to the characters.<br/><br/>The book goes deeper. Jack's father was also an angry drunk. Wendy's mom gives her cause to be neurotic and that's before she married Jack. Danny is still a little creepy, but all of the characters are a bit more sympathetic and certainly more three dimensional.<br/><br/>Jack's decent into madness is more tragic.

It's the only Apple product I own, and probably a long way from the original Apple II Woz designed in the 70's, but it still holds a special place in my heart. Without it I'm not sure if I'd work in computers today. I never tore it apart to learn how it worked or learned to code on it, but it sparked an interest in computers that has yet to fade.<br/><br/>The section on the 80's and Sierra and the early days of PC gaming might have been my favorite. I loved a lot of Sierra games in the 90's, in particular King's Quest 6/7 and all 3 Gabriel Knight games. I've backed several former Sierra developers on Kickstarter the last 2 years. It was interesting to read about the early days of that company and the games that laid the foundation for the games I loved as a kid.<br/><br/>The final brief section on Richard Stallman was so-so. I have a love/hate relationship with Mr. Stallman. The guys comes off as kind of an asshole. But without him/GNU, I doubt Linux would have ever taken off like him, and that powers so much of the things I love, including all my various Android devices. <br/><br/>I'm a big proponent of the open source movement that came out of his efforts, but don't necessarily agree that all software should be free and shared. I think there is a lot of merit shared code and my job is made easier by some of the more prominent open source projects out there. <br/><br/>However, it's unreasonable to think that someone is going to want to pay quality software developers for the sake of simply writing good code to share. And it's unreasonable to expect people to write quality software for free in their spare time. I think Mr. Stallman's unwillingness to concede this has hurt his own cause in many ways.<br/><br/>Overall this was a pretty good read, though it got a bit slow and repetitive in places, and less detailed that I would have liked on others. It makes me want to pick up a few more books that get more detailed on the early days of Apple and gaming companies in the 80's and 90's.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

PC games made me fall in love with the computer. It made me look at them as more than just game machines. I wanted to know how they work. I wanted to master them. John Carmack was one of my heroes. I wanted to make PC games for a living.<br/><br/>As with most childhood dreams, they rarely work out as planned. I did go on to be a software developer, just not for games. I am one of those Application developers the two Johns both loathed to be relegated to. I decided I'd rather play games than spend long hours making them. I'm grateful that they never gave up on the idea however.<br/><br/>I loved that this book not only got into the guys who made some of my favorite and inspiration games, but also quite a bit about the software process itself. No he didn't get super technical and talk about algorithms (much), but he did give insight to time, and skills and some of the big leaps John Carmack made along the way to cement his and Romero's names in history.<br/><br/>I will say that the software process stuff that I loved may have a negative effect on the casual gamer or even the more hardcore Doom/id fans that don't always have an interest in ""how the sausage is made"". <br/><br/>I think Mr. Kusher does an excellent job of balancing facts and dialogue in a way that you feel you're along for the ride without feeling like he's just making up conversations to fill pages which was my main issue with [b:Console Wars|18505802|Console Wars  Sega, Nintendo, and the Battle that Defined a Generation|Blake J.

It's really not though. The only real similarity with either series is that it's about a crew aboard a ship who aren't loyal to anyone but themselves. In some ways this makes it like Cowboy Bebop, but I find those characters instantly a lot more likeable than these.<br/><br/>And in this book, themselves is not so much each other as to their own self. I didn't like the captain (or most of the crew for that matter) very much at the start. They grew on me as the book went on.<br/><br/>The characters are all fairly interesting and different enough, just not the sort of people I'd want to hang around with. All of them have things in their past they'd like to keep there. The Ketty Jay is the perfect place for that. You don't ask about my past, and I won't ask about yours.<br/><br/>So more a crew full of strangers all running from their past. Darian Frey is no James Holden, and or even a Malcolm Reynolds. He only cares about his ship, and not the people on it.<br/><br/>This book serves like an origin story of sorts.

This was partly due to various chores and activities I had to finish that allowed me the opportunity to get extra listening in, and partly due to my desire to finish the story.<br/><br/>While I found it enjoyable, it's ending was mostly predictable, and I didn't think it was as strong as the previous novel.<br/><br/>One of the aspects of all the books in this trilogy that I didn't hit upon in my previous reviews is the heavy use of Christian allegory.<br/><br/>A key concept to the series is that your ability to channel ""the Medium"" is largely related to your belief in it. This relates to the notion of giving your will over to that of the Medium and faith that it will protect and bless you if you do so. Many of the abilities of the medium may only be used to the benefit of others and not oneself.<br/><br/>There is also a large theme of life after death, and resurrection of the dead. While these themes are present throughout the whole trilogy, they weren't as much at the forefront as they were in this book. The plot of this novel largely revolves around testing the main character Lea's faith in the Medium.<br/><br/>I'm reluctant to throw out the term ""Deus ex Machina"" because I feel that all the events fall within the explained abilities of the Medium and someone who is strong with it being able to perform those actions. I could see someone making a good case for it however.<br/><br/>Overall, I think Mr. Wheeler does a good job of wrapping things up with a neat bow.

I like to save them for books I really love so it's a sign that ""hey Rob must have really liked this one"". I don't exactly have a metric for what pushes a 4/4.5 star book to 5 star rating. It just sort of by feel.<br/><br/>The easiest way for me to quantify it though is that it's a book that I hate to stop and can't wait to pick up again. This book was easily that. It was also an easy add to my favorites shelf.<br/><br/>This book didn't grab me immediately, but pretty close. Once it did it never let go. It's hard to say why I loved it so much. It's a typical chosen one story. It's also got a bit of the school trope to it, though that's only part of the book.<br/><br/>At first it reminds me a lot of [b:The Name of the Wind|186074|The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)|Patrick Rothfuss|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1270352123s/186074.jpg|2502879]. Our main protagonist is an infamous man whose collected numerous names over the years, and is recounting his life story to a chronicler as a flashback, with occasional interludes back to present day. Sound Familiar?<br/><br/>However this basic structure is really where the similarity ends for me. Vaelin is a paladin (or maybe warrior monk?), where Kvothe is a bard (at least in my mind). He's far from perfect, and was instantly more likable to me.<br/><br/>I think what really hooked me in the story is the mystery and lore. There is a lot to discover in both the history of the Order that Vaelin is now a member, but also surrounding magic, regarded with superstition, anger and fear and referred to by most as ""The Dark"". The magic is sort of not that prevalent for most of the book, nor all that well explained, but I enjoyed how Mr. Ryan incorporated it into the story.<br/><br/>The other thing I really enjoyed is all the politics and religion. Religion and politics are tightly coupled and ""The Faith"" of the Order is embedded in the rule of the Unified Realm. Like the real world arguments over religion and politics lead to conflict and war.<br/><br/>King Janus is determined to leave a legacy for his son, and will use Vaelin how he sees fit to accomplish it.<br/><br/>The cast of characters felt well developed and balanced. Coming from different backgrounds and parts of the realm, Vaelin and his brothers make for an interesting group, each excelling at certain skills honed through training rather than just excelling at EVERYTHING. We also have a few strong female characters, although they don't really take center stage in this book.<br/><br/>Overall I think this book just put a lot of my favorites parts of fantasy tropes together in a way that just hits my buttons in the right way and made it a great read for me. The writing seems really polished for a first novel. I'm sure there are things that can be picked apart about the story or the writing, but I just don't want to hear them. <br/><br/>I will end my ramblings hoping that I have I have convinced you to check out this series.

I loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>The pacing might still be considered slow by those who found that the case in [b:The Way of Kings|7235533|The Way of Kings (The Stormlight Archive, #1)|Brandon Sanderson|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1388184640s/7235533.jpg|8134945], but I think it moves along faster as he doesn't have to do the kinds of setup he did in the first book.<br/><br/>One common comment I saw about book 1 was: ""What is the point of Shallan here?"". This book should answer that question for those people. While [b:The Way of Kings|7235533|The Way of Kings (The Stormlight Archive, #1)|Brandon Sanderson|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1388184640s/7235533.jpg|8134945] focuses on Kaladin, this is Shallan's book.<br/><br/>Don't fear Kaladin fans. You'll get plenty of him in this book, but he's just not the main focus here.<br/><br/>Once again this is a book that just kept building momentum as it went. It started as a book I looked forward to reading each night and changed to a book I had to force myself to put down.<br/><br/>The structure of the book is once again the same where you have 5 parts with various interludes between each. We are introduced to some pretty interesting new characters in these short interludes, as well as revisiting a few of those we met in [b:The Way of Kings|7235533|The Way of Kings (The Stormlight Archive, #1)|Brandon Sanderson|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1388184640s/7235533.jpg|8134945]. I would have to say that while I enjoyed them all, Lift, the young thief was my favorite. I hope we'll be seeing a lot more of her in future books, and not just the interludes.<br/><br/>The prologue is set at the exact same time as the prologue from [b:The Way of Kings|7235533|The Way of Kings (The Stormlight Archive, #1)|Brandon Sanderson|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1388184640s/7235533.jpg|8134945], only told from Jasnah's perspective instead of Szeth. This was a cool approach that I hope continues in the next few books at least. I'd like see Adolin's and Dalinar's take on these events at least.<br/><br/>I'd be remiss to review a [a:Brandon Sanderson|38550|Brandon Sanderson|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1394044556p2/38550.jpg] book without at least mentioning the magic system. I love the world building so far and the characters, but it's the magic system that once again shines the brightest. We learn more about surgebinding and how it works, but there is still so much left to discover. <br/><br/>His creativity not only at coming up with rules for various magic systems, but at how he applies those rules in ways I would have never considered always makes for great sequences.<br/><br/>Overall I was really happy with this book. Kaladin is still my favorite character, yet I think I might have enjoyed this one more despite his reduced focus. Shallan really developed from an interesting side story into a proper main character in her own right.<br/><br/>I am already looking forward to and dreading just a bit book 3 of this series. Will Mr. Sanderson be able to work his magic yet again? Well since he's writing this series for me personally, I'm sure he will.",,,1,,,1,2014/03/04,Amazon,Like new,,

I read this book as the April pick for <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword & Laser</a>. I was vaguely aware of it being considered one of the ""classics"" of fantasy. It hadn't really been on my radar as something I wanted to read.<br/><br/>In fact I had this feeling (based partially on discussing it with a friend who just read it for the first time recently) that I wasn't going to like it, so I borrowed it from the library rather than just buying it like I normally would. Maybe I was setting myself up to dislike it. Either way I'm glad I didn't buy it.<br/><br/>I didn't connect to a single human character in the entire book. I found them all to be pretty awful people that I wouldn't want to be around.<br/><br/>The only redeeming part of this book to me were the dragons. I think they were well done, and interesting/likable (for dragons). Maybe I'm not being forgiving to the fact the dragonriders themselves are just as arrogant as the dragons they ride.<br/><br/>Overall I found the plot lacking too. It seemed to jump all over the place, and when it finally came time to battle the ""threads"" that threatened Pern, it jumped off again (time travel: go!), then ended rather abruptly. Now I know there are more books, but I can't say I'm really itching to read them.<br/><br/>I will say I found the last third or so of the book much better than the first two-thirds, so really this is maybe a 2.5 for me rather than just a flat 2, but I couldn't give it a 3 after spending so much time looking for excuses not to read it. If it hadn't been a club pick and so short, I might have considered dropping it all together.<br/><br/>Maybe this is a book I would have enjoyed as a kid, but it's hard for me to say.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

His writing style doesn't jump out at me as exceptional, but it is well done. His characters have reasonable depth for such a short book and varying personalities.<br/><br/>The magic system feels original to me, based on various statues referred to as ""Leerings"" by commoners, or Gargoyles by the learned.

I'm happy to report quite well. I've had this pre-ordered in hardcover for months, but I think I may stick with audio if he continues as the narrator. Great voices and inflections that adds that little extra something that make an audio a great option for this book.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>Jim Butcher is my favorite author. I discovered him about 8 years ago, and quickly devoured his Dresden Files books. Then I moved right into his Codex Alera series. For three blissful years there was a Dresden Files book in April and a Codex Alera book in December.<br/><br/>Upon completing Codex Alera, Mr. Butcher's pace seemed to slow. I found the books as good as ever, or possibly even better, just far less frequent. At first it may anger fans of the Dresden Files that Mr. Butcher is writing something else. I'm here to tell you it shouldn't.<br/><br/>This book is excellent. I'd be surprised if any fans of Mr. Butcher don't also enjoy this. And hey, maybe writing two series at the same time will get us more excellent books to enjoy in a shorter period of time. It seems to have worked well for him in the past.<br/><br/>When I first heard of this series, my initial reaction was, Steampunk? Really? I must admit that I never really saw the appeal. I haven't read a lot of the genre, but what little I had read until recently didn't seem to be for me. My second thought was Well, I'd read Jim Butcher Twilight fan fiction if that's what he wanted to write. <br/><br/>The action starts almost right from the beginning. The pace is furious, with very few points of slowing. There was never a good stopping point in my listening and I always hated to put it down. To me that's what separates a 5 star rating from a solid 4.<br/><br/>We are quickly introduced to several characters. First we meet Gwen Lancaster, a young noblewoman determined to join the Spire Ark's guard. I had a bit of a mixed reaction to her. There were times I found her frustrating, but it's good to have a variety of characters, and Gwen helps to round things out nicely. <br/><br/>Next we meet Grim, the Captain of the airship Predator and various members of his crew. Grim is very much of the vein of Harry Dresden, though I see bit of Bernard from Codex Alera in him as well. He's easily likeable, but far from the best character in my opinion.<br/><br/>Bridget Targwen and her cat Rawl come next. Both are fantastic, especially Rawl. All of the cats are excellent, but especially Rawl. Mr. Butcher's cats are a bit reminiscent to me of those in Robin Hobb's Tawny Man Trilogy. He seems to nail cats exactly. And apparently the internet is crazy for cats, so instant bestseller, right?<br/><br/>Finally we meet Master Etherialist Ferris, and his apprentice Folly. Folly is absolutely my favorite! She reminds me a bit of Luna Lovegood. All of her scenes are highly entertaining. She's probably considered more of a secondary character to the first three, but I hope she continues to play a large role in the future books.<br/><br/>And if that's not enough there are several other secondary and tertiary characters that are all quite good, such as Gwen's cousin Benedict, members of the Predator: Creedy, Kettle and Journeyman and the Spire Ark himself: Lord Albion. <br/><br/>The antagonists are a bit cartoonish at times, especially Cavendish, but the two main Auroan soldiers felt more nuanced though.<br/><br/>This story is very character-driven, but Mr. Butcher has created a pretty interesting world for them to inhabit. There is very little steam powered anything though. Instead the main resource of note are Ethereal crystals. They power everything from Airships to hand weapons referred to as gauntlets.<br/><br/>Explanations for the world and magic systems are slowly metered out as the book goes on, but there were thankfully few info dumps. Or if there were, I was too busy enjoying myself to notice.<br/><br/>The book is fairly well self contained. Things end in a pretty good spot, especially considering this is the first book in a series. There are plenty of questions left to be answered, but most of the main conflicts of this book are either resolved, or put on hold nicely.<br/><br/>Overall if you enjoy Mr. Butcher other work, or enjoy character-driven faced paced action packed stories, pick this one up. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>Now I will once again eagerly have to await the next book in two series by Mr. Butcher, much like when I first discovered him. How lucky for us all!",,,1,,,1,2015/09/12,Review Copy,Like new,,

It's a great book to share with your kids if they are old enough.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I enjoyed this book, though not as much as his others. It's a young adult book, and unlike some books I've read in that category felt like it the whole way through.<br/><br/>The book has great illustrations. I'd highly recommend getting the print or ebook copy over the audio. I guess the audio comes with an errata of the pictures, but I'd find that sort of hard to work in, especially considering I'm usually doing something else while listening to audiobooks. The illustrations aren't high art, but they certainly add a lot to the story.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of Sanderson books, there isn't a whole lot of world building. From a map in the front of the book and a little of the discussion, apparently the United States is a series of Islands united under what seems more like the Articles of Confederation rather than the US Constitution.<br/><br/>The main thing that binds neighboring islands together are the academies where children are sent to learn how to be Rithmatists. Rithmatists are being trained to fight in a war in the center of the country against wild creatures that populated the country prior to the Europeans arrival. <br/><br/>There is some sort of federal jurisdiction, akin to maybe the FBI of sorts, but for the most part each island seems to keep to itself. The book is set in the early 1900s and has a bit of a Steampunk feel to it.<br/><br/>That's about all I could gather from the entire book. I'm sure he will flesh things out more as the series goes on.<br/><br/>As is the norm for a Brandon Sanderson novel, this series has an interesting and pretty unique magic system. Not as good as some of his others, but still interesting. Everything is based on drawing with chalk. Fans of Real-Time Strategy games will find the combat system familar. <br/><br/>You build your defenses, a base if you will, and there are various attacks you can do, including creating an army of chalkings to either attack or defend.<br/><br/>The protagonist is a 15 year old boy named Joel, whose mother works as a cleaning lady at the academy, where only Rithmatists and the richest non-Rithmatists can normally attend. He wants nothing more than to be a Rithmatist, but he was not chosen to be one.<br/><br/>Students begin to disappear, the Feds show up and one of the professors is tasked by the university to help figure out what is going on. Joel manages to get himself assigned to help in the hopes of learning more about Rithmancy that is normally kept from the non Rithmatists.<br/><br/>The story is decent, the writing is good, the characters are interesting, if a little cookie-cutter. The world building could have been a little better, even in a shorter young-adult novel. He does a bit at the end of the novel, but it is mostly setup for an inevitable sequel.<br/><br/>I was originally under the impression that this was a stand-alone story. I'm not sure if that was incorrect, or if it changed. I feel like the last few chapters could have been dropped with little detriment to the overall story and left it as stand alone.<br/><br/>That said when the next one comes out, I'll pick it up, though maybe not right away. I'm not the target demographic here, but I'd think pre-teens especially should enjoy this book. It might be a great book for parents to read with younger kids as well.",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

In many books an unlikable main character is easily enough to ruin a book. For some reason, I didn't find it the case here.<br/><br/>Kvothe is a prodigy in many things, but at the same time, I find him incredibly arrogant and lacking in common sense. Mr. Rothfuss's narrative, supporting characters and beautiful prose kept me interested in the story despite this.<br/><br/>With the sequel we find Kvothe is a little older, and thankfully a little wiser. As the story progresses, he is humbled, and bested on several occasions, and by the end of book I started to like him rather than loathe him as I mostly did through [b:The Name of the Wind|186074|The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)|Patrick Rothfuss|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1270352123s/186074.jpg|2502879].<br/><br/>With this book we also get several changes of scenery. About half of book follows Kvothe on adventures outside of the University where he always seems to be especially arrogant and stupid to me.<br/><br/>He is a lot more cautious and humble outside of that setting. This doesn't prevent him from being his own worst enemy from time to time, but it is reduced to a more tolerable level for my liking.<br/><br/>Mr. Rothfuss loves to embed stories within stories within stories, and this book is no different. There are some really great stories told that seem unrelated to main narrative at times, but you really have to wonder.<br/><br/>I like the idea of a ""bard"" main character rather than the stereotypical fighter/magician type. Through most of two books Kvothe travels not with a sword, but a lute.<br/><br/>My favorite part of this series has to be the supporting cast. In particular I love Auri and Devi, and want to know more about both. Like Kvothe I'm intrigued by Denna, and want to know what secrets she's hiding.<br/><br/>His friends Wil and Sim and the university are great as well. Mr. Rothfuss introduces some interesting new supporting characters in this book as well.

It's still early in the month but so far most of the discussion seems to be in the <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1233165-is-anyone-else-having-a-hard-time-getting-started"">Is anyone else having a hard time getting started?</a> thread. I must say I don't really understand this.<br/><br/>Sure this book is dense at times. The book also starts with a lot of world building. It gives you several character perspectives as well. But it's well written, and the plot is compelling.<br/><br/>It centers around a neutral space station over the planet Pell caught in the middle of a war between ""The Company"" and ""The Union"".<br/><br/>This book reminds me a lot of Star Trek: Deep Space 9 or Babylon 5. To a lesser degree Battlestar Galactica. Mostly because the latter had a lot more space battles. <br/><br/>Cherryh doesn't spend pages detailing epic battles here. Sometimes you see the aftermath, or get the report of a distant battle when news reaches Pell station. There aren't completely missing however. I like a good space battle as much as the next sci-fi geek, but it's not a requirement for me.<br/><br/>What this books does have is political-driven agendas, greed, ambition, and a surprising amount of compassion (at least from some of the characters). <br/><br/>Like some popular fantasy series I've read (Song of Ice & Fire/Malazan Fallen) Cherryh gives you multiple points of view on the situation. Unlike those books however, there aren't as many shades of grey. Or weren't for me. I knew pretty early on mostly whose good and whose bad, and I'm not suddenly surprised at the end. <br/><br/>There are some exceptions however that seem to reside in a shade of grey, but not many.<br/><br/>Overall a very enjoyable book. I'm a little disappointed to find out there is no true sequel to this book as there are a lot things I'm interested in reading more about in the aftermath. <br/><br/>The conclusion is satisfying however, and I hope to check out more books in this universe at some point down the road, but I won't be rushing out to get the next book just yet.",,,,,,0,,,,,

If the two books had been released as one however, I would have given it a lower rating.<br/><br/>In fact I found most of the last 4 books to be bogged down in far too many new subplots. I'm still left scratching my head over the point of a few of them. They didn't really offer much in the way of closure for me with the characters involved and mostly felt like a diversion in attempt to make the world more ""epic"".<br/><br/>The main story however was really enjoyable for the most part, when Erikson managed to focus on it. It featured all of my favorite characters doing some truly awesome things and some of my favorite moments in the series.<br/><br/>The humor, especially that of the marines is great as always. The relationships between many of the characters, even some of the more minor Malzans I find far more compelling that some of the subplots and characters introduced late in the series.<br/><br/>I plan to continue on with more Malazan eventually, and in a few years from now I might be up for a reread.

It's one thing to have information withheld from the reader when the point of view character doesn't know it. It's quite another when he does things like playing the pronoun game with characters we already know or don't allow us to hear a conversation that the point of view character is involved in.<br/><br/>This series is complicated enough with a huge amount of depth. This just seems overkill and the reason I can't give this book a 5 star rating.<br/><br/>Still this has been the most enjoyable of the series thus far.

Unlike that book however, I didn't find myself confused and frustrated at the beginning. I was simply uninterested. So unlike Midnight Tides where I enjoyed the story once I got my bearings, this one just kept leaving me bored for far too much of the book.<br/><br/>One of the flaws I often see in Epic fantasy is introducing too many characters and subplots that it bogs the story down. This is the main fault I found with the Wheel of Time series that could badly use editing to make books 8-10 into 1 or 2 much tighter novels.<br/><br/>This one isn't quite at that extreme, but I hope that things turn around with [b:Toll the Hounds|938544|Toll the Hounds (Malazan Book of the Fallen, #8)|Steven Erikson|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1316126179s/938544.jpg|3898730].<br/><br/>The Letherii/Tiste Edur story just isn't that interesting to me. Maybe it's because I find almost no likable characters in the bunch apart from Tehol and Bugg. All of the new characters, especially the Patriotists are despicable. <br/><br/>That's all well and good, but I feel Mr. Erikson spends entirely too much time convincing just how despicable they are. I think there were enough (or nearly enough) characters from [b:Midnight Tides|345299|Midnight Tides (Malazan Book of the Fallen, #5)|Steven Erikson|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1366996057s/345299.jpg|3898719] that could have been used to tell this story without adding so many new faces.<br/><br/>Thankfully the Malazans come to the rescue of this story, albeit a lot later than I would have liked. Old favorites like Fiddler and Quick Ben and the banter of the Marines are a relief from the tedium that is the Letherii/Edur story.<br/><br/>Mr. Erikson seems to always write really terrible beginnings (even though I know he's capable of writing good ones) but really excellent endings. This one is no different. However I won't let another strong ending fool me into forgetting about how bored I was for far too much of this novel.<br/><br/>There were enough enjoyable chapters in this book to save it from a 2-star rating, but overall this has been the weakest novel in the series for me so far.

I enjoyed that book all the way through.<br/><br/>No book in the series so far has shown this fact more than this one. I was about ready to quit the book in frustration. He introduced what seemed like 20 new characters in the span of maybe 2 chapters. This book has all of one character in it from the previous 4 books. And he was a relatively minor character that I was pretty indifferent towards. None of it made much sense to me.<br/><br/>I'm apparently not the typical Malazan fan in this. Everyone else seems to enjoy being thrown into the deep end at the start of each book. I don't. I'm pretty tired of it by now as my rant may indicate. I just don't get why all the hardcore Malazan fans do. I guess that means I'll never be one of them. Then again there are still 5 more books to go.<br/><br/>I'm really enjoying this series so far, but Mr. Erikson seems to go out of his way to alienate potential fans in my opinion. I don't mind all the layering and complex foreshadowing he does. I certainly don't get even a third of it, but it doesn't bother me. It just makes me feel pretty dumb/unobservant in a group reading setting.<br/><br/>OK, now that I got that off my chest. This book is sort of odd. The whole thing is a flash back. It's hard to say exactly when it occurs. It seems like the near past. I feel like this story might better have been told earlier in the series. Maybe it's beginning would have frustrated me less then, but probably not.<br/><br/>There are some really great characters in this book though. They are largely responsible for my enjoyment of this book. Mr. Erikson seems to have this obsession with pairs of characters, and Tehol and Bugg are now only second to Quick Ben and Kalam as my favorites.<br/><br/>Iron Bars is probably now one of my favorites as well. I wish we had gotten to see more of him in this book that we did. Hopefully we'll see more of him later in the series.<br/><br/>This book is much less action-packed than the previous four. There is a lot more politics in this one. That doesn't make it any less gruesome and dark. Just like the rest of the series, there are some truly disturbing scenes in this book.<br/><br/>As I got my feet about me again and got past the horrible beginning, I moved into a solid 3 territory. The ending of this was quite enjoyable, and the book became hard to put down. This bumped it to a 4 star by the end, which is saying a lot since I started at barely a 2.<br/><br/>I can't wait to jump into [b:The Bonehunters|478951|The Bonehunters (Malazan Book of the Fallen, #6)|Steven Erikson|http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1320434864s/478951.jpg|3898723], especially since most of my favorite characters look to be back.

Once again everything isn't so black and white, and I found myself changing my mind on some of the characters.<br/><br/>Mr. Erikson seems to have a fondness for duos, as there have been many such pairs throughout the series so far. One of the newer ones I've come to enjoy in this book is that of the Claw Pearl and Lostara Yil. We are also once again rewarded with more Iskaral Pust and Mogora, which offer some pretty amusing dialogues.<br/><br/>The only thing that detracted from this book for me was the story of Trull Sengar and Onrack. I just found myself indifferent and eager to get through there parts. It wasn't that I didn't like them, every good story needs unlikable characters. I just didn't care.

When living in a world of constant war, gods and demi-gods, it takes a certain kind arrogance for a human to throw himself in with the big boys and expect to triumph.<br/><br/>A great new addition to the cast was Gruntle, caravan leader.

I found it reassuring that even the re-readers were confused on certain points.<br/><br/>Mr. Erikson does seem to reward your patience and careful reading. As the book went on, and I started getting used to this new cast of characters, my frustration greatly lessened. This book started as 3 starts but slowly rose to 4 stars.<br/><br/>There are 4 main plot lines with a few side lines that diverge and converge as the story goes on. <br/><br/>My favorite was the story of Kalam, who was one of the few characters in the first book to appear in this one. Maybe it's because I've always gravitated towards rogues and ranger types in RPGs that I found his story so interest.<br/><br/>You learn a little bit more about his past, and find out just how badass a well trained assassin can be. Kalam in on a self-appointed mission for the good of the Empire, or so he believes.<br/><br/>The other major plotline of this book was from the perspective of Duiker, the Imperial Historian as he chronicles the months long evacuation of ""The Chain of Dogs"", Malazan refugees fleeing for their lives, in the midst of a great rebellion of the Seven Cities.<br/><br/>This leads to some of most gruesome battle scenes I have ever encountered. Mr. Erikson makes no attempt to sugar coat the horrors of war.<br/><br/>The final two fairly major plot lines in this book are enjoyable as well, but both of them tie back to the two I highlighted. Their cast of characters were interesting (and one of the two groups contained all the rest of the characters that appeared in the first two books). I felt like these were mostly interludes to the other action though. <br/><br/>The book comes to a reasonable stopping point, though if this were a stand alone book I'd find myself with too many questions to be satisfied by it.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to recommend this to someone to read on their own. If you don't mind working for your reward, or have someone you can read/discuss this with, and are not offput by gruesome and disturbing scenes it's another good entry in what so far has been a mostly enjoyable series.<br/><br/>I'm also a bit nervous about starting [b:Memories of Ice|175983|Memories of Ice (Malazan Book of the Fallen, #3)|Steven Erikson|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1316729348s/175983.jpg|836462] that I'll get frustrated all over again.

I did really enjoy his voice for Oberon however.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I've had several people tell me this is a great series, especially as a fan of the Dresden Files. I got a good deal on the first book from audible recently so I finally checked it out. Since this is comparison I hear a lot, I figure I'll give my a review as a sort of compare and contrast for anyone else out there whose loves Dresden and are considering these books.<br/><br/>I'm a little underwhelmed. I always tell people to give Dresden a few books before it really gets good. Maybe that will be true here as well. <br/><br/>Both have a snarky protagonist who can do magic and fights overwhelming adversaries. I don't enjoy the humor in this one nearly as much. [a:Jim Butcher|10746|Jim Butcher|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1205261964p2/10746.jpg] has me laughing out loud at least several times during a novel. This one I chuckled internally a few times, but that was it.<br/><br/>There are several other similarities that seem to be taken right from the pages of the later books of Dresden. I'll put them in spoiler tags so as not to spoil anything from either series, I consider both minor at this point but better safe that sorry: <spoiler>a dog sidekick and an attractive young female apprentice</spoiler><br/><br/>There are differences however. Atticus has fully embraced technology. He runs his own business and sells things online as part of it. This would be a problem for Harry. Atticus is very old and the last of his kind (that we know of anyways). Harry is considered young for a wizard.<br/><br/>The big highlight for me was Atticus's dog Oberon. I think Mr. Hearne does a good job portraying dog-like thoughts, or at least what I would guess them to be.<br/><br/>I found myself bored for at least the first 25% or so, but somewhere along the way I ended up enjoying it enough that I snagged the sequel on another daily deal from audible. I hope to see some growth in the second book or I may stop there.",,,1,,,1,,Audible,Like new,,

This was a free book from Audible, and only about 45 minutes, so well worth my time for the price.<br/><br/><b>About the Audio book:</b> This edition was read by the actor Alan Cummings. He's an excellent reader in the sense of his pronunciation/inflection. He did a bit of dialect and you could distinguish between someone educated such as Sherlock or Watson from a working man.

Why didn't I listen to you?<br/><br/>Shortly after joining good reads last year and putting all my books in, I checked out the recommendations page. This book was prominently listed based on several of my shelves. I read the description, and some of the reviews, and wasn't too impressed and moved on.<br/><br/>Fast forward about 6 months and a few of my newly made GR friends were making a group to do a series re-read. A few others decided to join in as first timers. I was convinced to give the series a try.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did. I can't say how I'll feel after all 10 books, but after the first one, I'm hooked!<br/><br/>The <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/85396-the-malazan-fallen"">group</a> is probably a large part of my enjoyment. I can see this book being very hard to read by yourself. There were a few parts that confused the hell out of me, that were explained to me by people who had been there before.<br/><br/>I'm very much a go with the flow and enjoy the ride type of reader. I'm OK if things don't make sense right away, so long as I get there eventually. Everything that confused me at the start was cleared up by the end. I'm not 100% if that was all book, or our great <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/85396-the-malazan-fallen"">group discussion</a>, but it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>The book certainly has left me with a lot of questions to be answered, but that's to be expected as the start of a 10 book series.<br/><br/>Mr. Erikson is an excellent writer. His descriptions, characters and language are all top notch. My only (minor) complaint would be that he sometimes seems intent on showing you just how good his vocabulary is.<br/><br/>The highlight for me is the character development. This book involves some very powerful people. And just when you think ""wow, what a badass"", someone more powerful shows up. I don't know if Dues Ex Machina possible when the gods themselves are part of the cast.<br/><br/>He also paints a very grey picture. One or two chapters in, I started to feel I knew who was ""good"" and who was ""bad"". Five chapters in, I had to re-evaluate my  initial assessments. I wouldn't be surprised if 2 books in, I re-asses them again.<br/><br/>Mr. Erikson introduces an interesting magical system with his use of Warrens. Unlike Brandon Sanderson who gives you a lot of detail and rules about how magic works, at least through 1 book the details are quite murky.<br/><br/>All and all, a great start to the series. It's a 4, but it's a very high 4, and the ending almost pushes it to a 5 for me. I'm already looking forward to continuing on with [b:Deadhouse Gates|55401|Deadhouse Gates (The Malazan Book of the Fallen, #2)|Steven Erikson|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1385272744s/55401.jpg|3898716] in two weeks.",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

I for one was very happy when I first reached the end. Both of them. I wonder if anyone really stops where he suggests?<br/><br/>I think both endings work well, though I prefer the actual ending to point where he tries to guilt you into stopping. He brings up the fact that the journey is always more important than the ending, and with the Dark Tower series, I certainly agree with him.<br/><br/>It is the journey part of this book, and not the ending that cost this book an extra star in my opinion. This books wanders a bit too much, and delves a bit too much into the background of new characters who in my opinion aren't that important to Roland's story.<br/><br/>This is only the second time I've read this book, and I enjoyed it about the same I believe. It's been many years now since I read it when it first came out in 2004 (I have a really nice Grant First Edition copy).<br/><br/>I've always felt the first half of the series (1-4) is much stronger than the latter half he wrote in one go after his near death experience. That isn't to say it is bad, or that I'm unhappy.<br/><br/>It might simply be changes to me, and not the series. I started this series in high school, and read and re-read the first four books more times than I can remember while waiting on Mr. King to finish. By the time the story was concluded I was mostly done with college.<br/><br/>On this audio journey, I got to revisit old places and old friends (and enemies) as Roland and his Ka-tet journeyed to the Dark Tower. I started it because I had some friends who were reading it for the first time. One dropped out after just the first book, but the other continued on and seemed to enjoy the series nearly as much as I have.<br/><br/>These days I don't have much time for re-reading. There are too many books that I want to read. This series might be an exception. I'm not sure if I'll ever read my physical copies again (listening is just a lot more convenient for re-reads), but I'm sure this won't be the last time I quest out for the Dark Tower.

While I think this is probably the weakest of her Elderling series books, I still greatly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Ms. Hobb once again has a way with writing characters that feel real, especially in the way they can frustrate your and make you down right furious.<br/><br/>She has a way of making me just enjoy following her characters around as they go about their lives. I feel like not as much happened in these four books as have in her previous trilogies.

What it does have is complex characters dealing with the complexity that is life: love, hate, greed, courage in a fantastical setting. Somehow that's enough for me. It may not be enough for everyone.<br/><br/>There are some complaints I could make, but not many and I won't really dwell on them. I would have liked to see some more time spent with characters from Liveship.

They face the first real adversity of their journey to find an ancient lost city of the Elderlings where the dragons may be able to thrive.<br/><br/>At its heart, this is a story about relationships. Sure there are dragons, but as intelligent creatures that are able to communicate with their keepers, their relationships play as large of a role (if not a larger one) than the interpersonal relationships of the humans.<br/><br/>Her characters are once again superb. I don't think I despise fictional characters quite so much as some of the ones Ms. Hobb has written. While none of these are quite as despicable as Regal or as frustrating as Malta, they are memorable.<br/><br/>The way Ms. Hobb writes, I feel like I could just fall right into her books and stay there.

It's become a pretty trendy pick as of late, and <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword and Laser</a> chose it for the May pick this year.<br/><br/>While this is technically 5 connected stories, I think it reads much better as a novel. I think only the first story is satisfying by itself.<br/><br/>My original plan was to read the first 3 stories (a little under half the book) one weekend, then finish the book the next. Well Mr. Howey ruined those plans. When I got to the end of the third story I couldn't stop. Instead of reading 125 pages I read over 200, and put my original reading plans on hold so I could finish this first.<br/><br/>To me that's the ultimate sign of a great book. If you find yourself going out your way or re-arranging plans just to read.<br/><br/>The story mostly reads like a mystery novel, in a post-apocalyptic setting. People live in a large underground society. To the inhabitants, this is what life is like, and has always been like.<br/><br/>There is a screen on the top floor that shows ""outside"". The imagine slowly degrades over time as the camera gets dirty. To think of going outside is dangerous, to express that thought is a crime. <br/><br/>Many secrets lie beneath the surface, but discovering them can lead to your death. Through the series of five stories, we learn how things got the way they are.<br/><br/>I find it interesting that given recent events Mr. Howey is now considered by some to be sexist, when he's written one of the best female characters I've read in a long time. Personally I think the ""controversy"" has been overblown, and shouldn't deter anyone from checking this novel out.<br/><br/>The pace of the first three stories are pretty breakneck, but Mr. Howey does a great job of world building, especially in the second story. The pace slows down greatly in the final two books, especially the final one. I think the third story was my favorite part of the five.<br/><br/>Despite this the ending did feel a little rushed, and I'm certainly eager to continue on in the series. <br/><br/>The next set of stories is a prequel of sorts and helps to fill in some of the gaps I've been told, but what I really want to know is what happens next. Hopefully the next set of stories Mr. Howey is currently working on, will pick up where this one left off.",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

I don't know what it will take to finally force a change, but meanwhile innocent consumers continue to have their lives upended by it.<br/><br/>I didn't find this book too technical, though given my background, I'm usually a bad judge of these things.

I tend to read a mix of book club reads, just released books, and spur of the moment picks depending on my mood. I'm really bad about working off my backlog. I got this one as a Christmas gift from my sister a few years ago, and it's just been sitting unread on my bookshelf.<br/><br/>I took finally doing this as a group read with my side reads group to finally get me to pick it up. I'm really glad I did. It was a lot of fun. <br/><br/>It's a fairly short book, and I don't have a lot to say about it. The main character is fine, but I never really clicked with him. I liked most of the supporting characters better. For me what really hit home was the idea of this strange little bookshop that was really more of a library than a story.<br/><br/>The other elements that resonated with me were the uses of technology and just the San Francisco setting. My sister lives there, and I've visited her a few times now. There are elements of the city wound throughout this book that I probably would have glossed over had I not experienced them myself. Those things aren't really important to the story's plot, but makes me itching for my next visit.<br/><br/>I thought this book had a nice message, and I was happy with how the mysteries of the book were resolved. It's always refreshing to pick up a book that stands alone, especially one this short and feel satisfied. It seems like everything is stretched out into monster tomes of no less than 3 books. Then again, maybe that's just the result of me reading so much fantasy. <br/><br/>I don't read much contemporary fiction, but this one worked really well for me. I think most book nerds will find some things to like here.",,,1,,Jess Zak,1,2014/12/26,,Like new,,

As long as the movie is, the book is longer, and seems to have a tendency to go off on seemingly irrelevant tangents. I would say if you enjoyed the movie, you'd enjoy the book, but I find little reason to do so.<br/><br/><b>Audio Book:</b> Joe Montegna  does a good job reading this, doing voices for some of the characters, including a passable impersonation of Brando's Vito Corleone. <br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I did the audiobook, so it's a bit hard for me to talk about the prose of the author, but while the overall story is quite excellent, I found the writing a bit lacking.<br/><br/>Puzo has a tendency to ramble on in great detail about things that have little to no impact on the plot. He goes into depth with minor characters in what I assume is an attempt to give them a richer back-story, only to slow down the main plots.<br/><br/>You do get some more insight into the mindset of the characters, which is fairly common when comparing a book to a movie, since it offers the ability for internal monologue much better. But the acting/screenplay for the movie is so well done, I don't think this makes it worth the extra time of reading the book.<br/><br/>Another nice addition to the book that was cut from the first movie (but included in the second) was Vito's background from Italy to his rise to Don. That makes it easier to understand some of his motivations and decisions that could otherwise seem confusing.<br/><br/>Overall, I found it to be a good distraction from the long car trips (6-7 hours at a time) I took this past weekend, but this isn't a book I think I would have enjoyed sitting down to read as much. I would have likely stopped reading and opted to watch the movie again instead.",,,,,,0,,,,,

I love science-fiction, and have for as long as I can remember, but I tend to consume my sci-fi mostly through TV and the movies rather than books.<br/><br/>For this reason I had never heard of John Scalzi before hearing about [b:Redshirts|13055592|Redshirts|John Scalzi|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1348617890s/13055592.jpg|18130445] last year sometime. Even then his name didn't really stick with me. It should have, but he didn't. I'm pretty horrible with names.<br/><br/>When discussing this book as a possible pick for our book club, one member commented something to the effect that it was a bad pick, because anyone who truly wanted to read this book would have by now. So here I am, very late to the party. And what a party!<br/><br/>More than anything I found myself laughing aloud while reading this book. It's my first by Mr. Scalzi. Despite hearing about [b:Redshirts|13055592|Redshirts|John Scalzi|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1348617890s/13055592.jpg|18130445] first, I still haven't gotten around to reading it. It defiantly won't be my last.<br/><br/>There is a fair bit of swearing in this book, and what I'd call low-brow humor, so if that's not for you, you may not find it as funny as I did.<br/><br/>The characters outside of the main one don't have a whole lot of depth to them, but that's OK. This isn't a book you read for it's in deep plot and complex characters. It's popcorn, plain and simple.<br/><br/>With my usual ""no spoilers"" policies for review, I won't talk about the technologies used at all, other than to say there is nothing ground breaking there. Mr. Scalzi makes use of some well used ideas, but combines them in some fun ways. <br/><br/>He doesn't go into a lot of depth on how it works, making this about as far from hard sci-fi as you can get. He gives you just enough of an explanation to set things up, then moves on.<br/><br/>The aliens in this book are diverse and interesting, though again their isn't a lot of depth there. You don't always get a good feel for who the majority of the alien species are or why they are fighting. Really the variety of species is mostly to offer a variety of combat scenarios the main character has to deal with.<br/><br/>I was satisfied by the ending, but their are enough lingering questions that I plan to check out other books in the series when I get some more time.",,,,,,0,,,,,

It ended up being one of the picks for July in <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword & Laser</a> so I finally fit it in.<br/><br/>I read it over the course of 2 weekends, which with the way I've been lately is a really long time. The book is only 340 pages, and I read nearly half of it in one day. What was I doing the other 4 or 5 days that I was ""reading"" it?<br/><br/>Well not, much. I'd get an email notification and I'd go off and spend 10-15 minutes on the tablet instead of reading. Or I wouldn't even pick the book up to begin with.<br/><br/>I haven't read a lot of ""classic"" Sci-Fi, but most of them seem to be big on ideas, and little on much else. I liked the characters for the most part in this book, but there wasn't a ton of depth there. I think Speaker to Animals was by far the most interesting of the bunch.<br/><br/>Somewhere around the halfway point though, some new facts came to light and the story just seemed to click in and I managed to finish it fairly quickly.<br/><br/>I have a bit of a science background. My engineering degree has a lot of foundation in math and science. I haven't really used most of that in over 10 years, but I do find Hard Sci-Fi a bit interesting. I don't pretend to be smart enough to look at what Mr. Niven wrote and prove or disprove the science behind it.<br/><br/>The concepts in this book are really cool. Building planets and instantaneous travel among others. The actual plot wasn't anything spectacular however.<br/><br/>It's one of those books I'm glad I read, but probably won't read again, or go off recommending as something you MUST read.",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

So reading it at the same time, didn't really help this book's cause. Then again, I think I would have struggled with it regardless.<br/><br/>My main issues are the pacing and the quality of the writing. The story itself was fine, though nothing particularly great. It seems as though this book was all about hurry up and wait. Pages and pages would go by where it felt like nothing was really happening. They were walking somewhere or talking about, well I can't remember what at this point, but it didn't feel important to the plot. Then something interesting would happen and it would be over really quickly. I wish he had spent more time on plot developments and less time moving his characters around.<br/><br/>As to the writing, I'm not someone who needs brilliant prose to enjoy a book. Most of my favorite authors will never been awarded for their literary techniques. I'm even pretty forgiving to first time authors. The thing is, if you're writing is lacking, you need to make up for it with entertainment value. And this book just didn't. I found myself paying more attention to the words on the page than the story they were trying to tell. His constant repetition of descriptive phrases like ""The Valeman"", ""The borderman"" and ""The Northmen"" became a huge annoyance as the book went on.<br/><br/>The characters and the world building were nothing special either. I didn't really care about either. I've been mostly enjoying the Shannara TV show, which is apparently based on [b:The Elfstones of Shannara|189783|The Elfstones of Shannara  (The Original Shannara Trilogy, #2)|Terry Brooks|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1420148388s/189783.jpg|2121201]. The world building there seems more apparent and interesting here. We get maybe one small part where Allanon is info dumping about the past to give you any sense that this a post-apocalyptic version of our world (or one much like it) rather some standard fantasy world based on medieval Europe. <br/><br/>What's strange is that Elfstones seems to feature female characters quite a bit, while this one makes them feel like an afterthought. How do people still exist without women? Oh they are there after all? Who knew? We go probably 500 pages before a women is even mentioned, let alone has lines. This is far from the only fantasy book with this issue, but it struck me odd after the show having several.<br/><br/>Overall I think if this book had been 200-300 pages shorter and focused more on plot, world building or character development instead of moving characters around I'd have enjoyed it a lot more. I'm not sure if I'll try the next book or not. There is just too much to read, and not enough time and this one hasn't really motivated me to continue.",,,1,,,1,2016/01/31,Amazon,Good,,

The latter being another series I read that has a detective Angel for the protagonist.<br/><br/>I don't think it's nearly as good as Dresden. It reminds me a bit of [b:Storm Front|47212|Storm Front (The Dresden Files, #1)|Jim Butcher|http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1345556917s/47212.jpg|1137060], where the concept is intriguing, but the book itself is only so-so. However, unlike Mr. Butcher, this isn't Mr. Williams first book.<br/><br/>I'd put it on par with Remy Chandler. I think the quality of the writing by Mr. Williams is a little better, but the quality of the plots seems to be about the same. I was pleased to see they both have very different takes on the Angel thing. <br/><br/>While Remy fought in the battle of Heaven and Hell, Bobby is uncertain of many things, including his own past. Bobby doesn't seem to have any kind of super human abilities and is limited by his body. Remy can embrace his Angelic nature and become more powerful/scary.<br/><br/>The book started out OK, but really went on to drag in the middle before picking up steam again at the end to finish alright. He does bring the mystery of the first book to a reasonable conclusion, while setting up some larger mysteries I assume he will address in the next two books.<br/><br/>The other I guess minor gripes I have about the book were the humor and the sex. I don't mind sex in books. It's a large motivator in human (or in this case Angelic) actions.<br/><br/>However Mr. Williams went into a lot more detail (across several chapters) than I thought was necessary. This will likely be popular for the 50 shades of gray/Paranormal Romance crowd, but for me, I just skimmed through it to get on with the actual story. The sex was important to the story, but could have been less detailed without losing any of that.<br/><br/>Humor is very subjective. I love Jim Butcher/Harry Dresden's sense of humor. I didn't really care for Tad Williams/Bobby Dollar's. I could tell some of the places he was trying to make jokes and they just didn't do it for me. He did have 1 or 2 others.

This one is hard to put down and whole lot of fun.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>This book has a whole lot of influences mixed together in a way that is impressive: Part Ocean's Eleven, Part Godfather and Part Fantasy. <br/><br/>The back cover totes Part Robin Hood, but since I didn't see the Gentleman Bastards giving any of their stolen loot to the poor, I don't really agree with that one. They DO have a Robin Hood reputation in the book, even if it's untrue.<br/><br/>Mr. Lynch paints a gorgeous world that could be a whole separate series of it's own. They city is full of amazing buildings from some long dead society and the current people are just living in it now.<br/><br/>We meet young Locke Lamora at the age of 5, and already he's trouble. Stealing from guards and breaking all the rules of the ""Silent Peace"" that has been established between Capa Barvosi (the Godfather) and the Nobility.<br/><br/>I really love the structure of this book. That's not something I usually comment on in my reviews, but it's really worth bringing up here. There is a fairly beefy prologue set in the past where we get a little background on our protagonist. Then in chapter 1 we are in present day with an adult version of Locke and his Gentleman Bastard friends.<br/><br/>It then alternates with Interludes flashing back to the past and filling in details about Locke and his friends lives. The interludes get short and eventually skipped in some places as the present day story really gets going.<br/><br/>It was well executed. I didn't find myself grumbling when an interlude came up interrupting the main story. It always added something important, and I liked how they got shorter as the book went on.<br/><br/>The characters are really great. Locke and Jean are probably the most developed, but the supporting characters are all interesting and feel to have depth. I'd really love to get more details on his master and founder of the Gentleman Bastards, Chains. He seems to have lived an interesting life, and what we did of his past left me wanting more.<br/><br/>It is once again another series where it seems like the Mages are assholes. That's probably more realistic. If you could do magic and were more powerful than most people, would you really be as benevolent as Gandalf? I think most people would end up like Saruman instead, and in this series we have a whole guild full of them.<br/><br/>The rules of the magic seem non-existent. It's hard to know just what a Mage is capable of, but it's pretty damn impressive, and scary. These are not people you want to mess with.<br/><br/>I've marked this as grimdark, but while there are some truly awful things in it, it's not as dark as some of the other stuff I've been reading. It's more of an adventure/caper story than anything else.<br/><br/>I finished the book a day earlier than I had planned, and if I hadn't been so busy last weekend, I might have finished it even sooner. This book grabbed me early on and never let go. I can't wait to see what Locke gets up to in the next book.",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

I ignored both books until convinced otherwise by friends of mine. <br/><br/>Apparently good reads recommendation engine knows what it's talking about, and I shouldn't ignore it. I really enjoyed this book. It took me a few chapters to get into it, but once I was it was hard to put down.<br/><br/>It's often described as gritty fantasy, and it certainly delivers on that front but I didn't find this book as dark as either <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/series/43493-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen"">Malazan Book of the Fallen</a> or <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/series/43790-a-song-of-ice-and-fire"">Song of Ice and Fire</a>. It's certainly not a book to share with your younger kids however.<br/><br/>This is the first book I've read by Mr. Abercrombie, and his first published work. It doesn't show. The book is very well polished. The characters are interesting, diverse and have a lot of depth.<br/><br/>If you would have told me I'd like an arrogant spoiled rich noble, and deformed malicious torturer as characters before this book, I wouldn't have believed you. <br/><br/>And that's neglecting to mention Logen ""The Bloody Nine"". He's got a reputation as a viscous killer, and numerous enemies who want him dead, yet for most of the book you wonder how that's possible. He seems more like a grizzled warrior whose simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time for most of his life, but somehow manages to survive.<br/><br/><i>""I'm still Alive!""</i><br/><br/>Eventually however, you learn that his name is well deserved.<br/><br/>I think Mr. Abercrombie does a good job of painting a world that is not black and white. His characters all have flaws, some of them major, yet I find myself liking and rooting for them all somehow.<br/><br/>I have two small fall criticisms of the book that prevent me from giving it a 5:<br/><br/>1) Lack of strong female characters. They aren't absent, just secondary. Both Ardee and Ferro are well developed in this story, but most (all?) of the point of view story telling is from the various other male protagonists, of which there are 5, compared to only 2 females, one of which only appears occasionally (Ardee) and the other (Ferro) who isn't introduced until much later in the book.<br/><br/>One thing I think that [a:George R.R. Martin|346732|George R.R. Martin|http://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1351944410p2/346732.jpg] does well is providing a sense of realism, yet still offering a good mix of female characters. I'm hoping we see more from Ardee and Ferro in the next book, and hopefully some additional woman as well.<br/><br/>2) As I mentioned in my summary, this book lacks some kind of short term goal. If there is any goal, it's essentially getting the group together to go on a quest of sorts. That's not really explained very well. The stopping point for this book was reasonable, but it was just that, a stopping point.<br/><br/>Say one thing for this book, say it's an enjoyable read.

It simply confirmed those suspicions while leaving me questions I hope will finally be answered in the last book.<br/><br/>This book does suffer a bit from middle book syndrome. A lot of it really sets up the final book in the trilogy. That doesn't mean I was bored along the way, simply that the ending didn't come to any satisfying conclusion. <br/><br/>Really it just leaves me hoping for a lot of things to be resolved in the final book. When I was done I wanted to jump right into the final book, but didn't have time due to the holidays.",,,,,,0,,,,,

Probably from Sword & Laser, which selected it for the June 2013 pick.<br/><br/>There are several things in this book I greatly identify with. There is one scene when the main character meets other people who share her interest in sci-fi and fantasy books and feels both self-conscious about that she is talking too much and yet at the same time is unable to control herself. I've been there entirely too many times in my life, especially after long periods of mostly being alone and catching up with friends.<br/><br/>The main part that I identify with is losing yourself in books. This is something I seem to be doing more and more of lately, for several reasons. I'm thankful for good reads as an outlet to discuss them all, and to find other people who read as much as I do.<br/><br/>So why only 3 stars? Well there were three main reasons:<br/><br/>1) The early part felt very ramblely to me. As someone prone to rambling I can forgive this in conversation, but not really in a book. It's meant as a diary of a teenage girl, so this is probably realistic, but was too realistic for me. <br/><br/>This leads me to my next problem:<br/><br/>2) As the diary of the teen-aged girl, there were parts I just couldn't identify with. Having never been a girl myself, and understanding entirely too little about the female species in general some parts of this book were just awkward for me. Not a fault of the book, just something that didn't resonate with me personally.<br/><br/>And my final drawback was:<br/><br/>3) All the book references. I'd like to think I've read a decent number of books in my nearly 30 year reading career (I don't remember exactly what age I started reading books). I've tracked over 200 books on good reads, and I know there are books I've read missing from the list, especially if I counted all the stuff I read as a kid. <br/><br/>There are at least 80 books referenced in this novel from the various lists I've seen. I've read less than 10 of them. That made for a lot of references I'm sure I just missed out on. This is another thing that isn't the book's fault. <br/><br/>This book is set in 79/80. I was born in 82. I didn't really start reading a ton of sci-fi or fantasy until the early 2000s. Most of what I've read was written after I was born.<br/><br/>I LOVED [b:Ready Player One|9969571|Ready Player One|Ernest Cline|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1333576871s/9969571.jpg|14863741]. It's chock full of geeky 70's and 80's nostalgia. If you took that away, the book wouldn't have been nearly as good. So that might be exactly what's happened here for me.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm glad I read this, but I'm also glad I'm glad I opted to borrow it from the library. With inter-library loan no less!

The jury is still out, but it looks like I might have done a poor job. I enjoyed the reread, but this book won't be for everyone.<br/><br/>I've always been fascinated by the early days of computers and the internet, especially where computer cracking is involved. The late 70s and the 80s were basically the wild west. The idea of networked computers was so new that government was slow to react to those who took advantage. <br/><br/>When they did finally react, it was often to an extreme, which I think is evident in some of the treatment Mr. Mitnick receives from law enforcement. Some of the rumors that developed around him over the years were pretty ludicrous. Not all of them however, and he could be a scary person to cross.<br/><br/>I've read many books on the subject over the years. It's one of the few non-fiction subjects I'm interested in enough to read on my own away from school assigned reading. I even wrote a term paper on it in High School. How I managed to convince my teacher to let me read a bunch of books on computer crime, I don't really remember at this point.<br/><br/>It's hard to read about computer crime and not come across Kevin Mitnick. He's arguably the most famous, or at least the most notorious computer ""hacker"" of his time.<br/><br/>I find it interesting that Mr. Mitnick has embraced the new definition of Hacker. In fact he doesn't even bother to explain the difference. Back when he was active he would have been considered more of a Phone Phreak (which he does cover a bit) or a Cracker.<br/><br/>Hacker used to be a nickname for obsessive computer types that would dig into depths of systems and code looking for the nooks and crannies.<br/><br/>Maybe he chooses to call himself a Hacker because he's trying to appeal to a wider audience that wouldn't know the difference. Or maybe it's because he doesn't seem to feel like what he did was all that wrong, and might self identify with the original definition.<br/><br/>While Mr. Mitnick's computer skills are no doubt impressive, I think most of his success can be attributed more to his Social Engineering skills rather than his technical ability. That and his ability to exploit the things he learns.<br/><br/>Social Engineering for those unfamiliar, can be defined as <i>the art of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information</i>. <br/><br/>It essentially a different way of saying to con someone, or the term used where computers and/or technology is involved. It relies heavily on knowledge of your targets security procedures and vulnerabilities. Often time people are the weakest link in computer security.<br/><br/>Most of what Mr. Mitnick does is built on the work of others, exploiting bugs found by other people and the trusting and/or lazy nature of people rather than discovering new flaws on his own.<br/><br/>He manages to obtain the source code for numerous operating systems over the years, but often time doesn't bother to spend any time looking at the code, he simply obtains it like a trophy.<br/><br/>I can only theorize that he's incredibly charismatic. Reading this book he doesn't come off as a very likable person to me, yet people seem to jump to help him, even as he abuses their trust and love. That's probably part of why he's so successful at Social Engineering.<br/><br/>One of my friends describe the book as repetitive. For someone not interested in the technology aspect, I can see how this is true. At a high level he used a lot of the same techniques to break into more and more complex systems, especially as the level of computer knowledge and security practices continued to evolve over the years.<br/><br/>He tries to explain the various technical terms as he goes, and I had no trouble following what he wrote, but I was already familiar with a lot of the stuff ahead of time. <br/><br/>It might get tedious or frustrating to those without any background. Similarly it might get tedious to those with more technical knowledge as he explains what may seem like basic concepts.<br/><br/>The book seems to toggle between him trying to elicit sympathy from the reader for his exploits, and apologizing to the people he wronged over the years, especially his mother and grandmother.<br/><br/>To be fair, a lot of incorrect and overly negative things were published about Mr. Mitnick over the years, while he was legally prevented from telling his side of things.<br/><br/>Like I said in my original review, I'm sure the truth is somewhere in the middle of the two extremes.<br/><br/>Despite the negatives, his story is an incredibly unique, and to me at least an interesting one. Parts of it read like it's straight from a spy novel. He uses his abilities not only to hide from his pursuers, but to spy on them to see how close they are getting.<br/><br/>In the end his ego, and his inability to stop breaking into computer systems proves to be his downfall. He may not think so, but considering the fear he elicited in those pursuing and prosecuting him, he was incredibly lucky to come away like he did, and now to have a successful business where people pay him to do the kinds of things he went to jail for.<br/><br/><br/><b>------------------Original Review------------------</b><br/>Forgot to add this book. I noticed after putting another book on my shelves.<br/><br/> I recall really enjoying this. After reading several books biased against Mitnick, it was nice to contrast that with something biased for him instead.<br/><br/>It's hard to know what really happened. I'm sure it lies somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/> Either way, it is a pretty interesting read and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in computers, or social engineering. It really is scary the kinds of things he can do.",,,2,,,1,,,Like new,,

At the same time there are certain themes throughout that tie things together. The changes could be jarring at first, but once I got into the next story a little it was fine.<br/><br/>This book started off really slowly for me. Once I got into the later stories (Luisa Rey onwards) and through the <b>Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After</b>, the second half of the book just flew by.<br/><br/>As I think on this book/discuss it more and end up raising my rating some.

For me, everything seems to pale compared to the Dresden Files.<br/><br/>The other problem I had was it seemed like a generic Urban Fantasy series with stock vampires. Or mostly stock. Mr. Hines does work in a large variety based on various popular vampire novels over the year, including the sparkly variety that have pretty much have ruined what little interest in vampires I once had.<br/><br/>The main character seems generic too. Well except that he's a librarian instead of private eye or some sort of field agent. This may appeal to the librarians out there, but I'm not sure who else.<br/><br/>The second half of the book was a lot better however. Thankfully the whole thing wasn't about vampires. We also got more with the magic system, which is really the only thing that makes this book stand out. <br/><br/>Mr. Hines has come up an interesting and certainly unique system. Pulling magic items out of books. My only gripe is that while some things are explicitly named (Harry Potter, Doctor Who), other things are only alluded to (Star Wars). I'm not sure if it's over copyright concerns or what. If so that's yet another negative side effect of copyright. There is no way I'd confuse this book with a Star Wars book, simply because a character pulls a lightsabre out of a book. I mean who WOULDN'T do that if you had the ability?<br/><br/>Overall I think this is a book that will largely depend on how much you enjoy Urban Fantasy. If you're a fan, this may be a book to check out. If not, I don't think the strength of the magic system is enough to compensate for the mostly generic Urban Fantasy story.",,,1,,,1,2014/02/10,Audible,Like new,,

I thought the characters were well developed. You share a sense of concern with the protagonist for the motivations of the others. You are left to decide along with her who is being honest and who might be lying and why.<br/><br/>Jaffe also does a good job describing the planet and an ecology of this strange unexplored planet.<br/><br/>It is a story of survival and self exploration, with a bit of a mystery mixed in.<br/><br/><b>The not-so-good:</b><br/><br/>The book starts out at some point in the future, then flashes back. I presume it was done to draw the user in and present them with engaging questions. I just mostly found it confusing. <br/><br/>This technique seems to be overused in TV these days, so that might be why I'm particularly sensitive to it.<br/><br/>I flipped back to re-read the beginning a few times once I was further in the book to remind myself what happened to try to piece things back together. Overall this is a minor gripe on my part though.<br/><br/>The first part of the book moved a bit slow for my liking. Some of the detail Jaffe used to set up the main character felt a bit drawn out.<br/><br/>I was also a little underwhelmed by the primary ending (there are some things that occur after the ""big reveal"", but it's mostly prologue). I still feel that he wrapped things up sufficiently though.<br/><br/>",,,,,,0,,,,,

When this came out however, I held back. I didn't really want to jump into what he promised to be a maybe 10 book series. I wanted to wait for it to be done/nearly done.<br/><br/>Fast forward a few years, two more excellent Wheel of Time books by Mr. Sanderson, and there was suddenly a hole in my reading. <br/><br/>I got to meet him in February at a signing for [b:A Memory of Light|7743175|A Memory of Light (Wheel of Time, #14; A Memory of Light, #3)|Robert Jordan|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1336055749s/7743175.jpg|10558806] and I felt bad that I had nothing that was exclusively his to sign in hardcover. That pretty much settled it for me and I managed to find a new first edition copy of the book online.<br/><br/>There is a lot of world building in this book. That's to be expected from book one of what looks to be a long series. There is a lot of time jumping, especially at the beginning.<br/><br/>After the brief first scene ends, we jump 4500 years into the future. Then there is a short prolouge, where we meet a bad-ass (though reluctant) assassin named Szeth. Then it jumps another 5 or 6 years before the main story gets rolling.<br/><br/>As the story begins we meet Kaladin Stormblessed. No he's not a farm boy suddenly thrust on an unexpected adventure, he's a unit commander in the military. He's a little bit older (19) than your typical fantasy trope hero as well. <br/><br/>That isn't to say he doesn't suffer from any tropes, but he feels like a refreshingly original character. I also appreciated the way Mr. Sanderson introduces him to you, in what I can only assume to be a nod to the prototype fantasy protagonist.<br/><br/>Mr. Sanderson makes use of flash back chapters starting 9 years in the past and slowly moves them forward in time filling you on how Kaladin came to be where he was.<br/><br/>We are next introduced to Shallan, a young noble woman set out on a mission to save her family from ruin. I've seen complaints that her parts of the book are ""pointless"" to the plot of this book, but I disagree. <br/><br/>While she has no roll in the main plot, Mr. Sanderson is building out his world and some of the key players in it. By the end of this novel it's apparent just how important Shallan's story line will be.<br/><br/>The first and third books of this novel deal with these two characters. <br/><br/>Starting in the second book, and continuing in the fourth, we are introduced to Dalinar and his son Adolin the Uncle and cousin of the King of Alethkar respectively. <br/><br/>Their chapters replace Shallan's while Kaladin's continue on.<br/><br/>It becomes apparent early on that Kalodin story is on a collision course with Dalinar but the journey to get there was enjoyable. Not to mention that the events surrounding their meeting as just pure awesomeness.<br/><br/>The final book makes use of all the character perspectives, and sets things up for the next novel. This novel is not stand-alone by any means, but I knew that coming in. That said, I think Mr. Sanderson found a good stopping point to conclude on.<br/><br/>I now eagerly await [b:Words of Radiance|11543195|Words of Radiance (The Stormlight Archive, #2)|Brandon Sanderson|/assets/nocover/60x80.png|16482835], and I suspect the many other books to follow.",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

I read it sometime in high school. I don't exactly remember when. However, I remember seeing the movie the first time vividly. I was not quite 11 years old. The perfect age really. I convinced my mother to take me to see it while my sister was away at camp. The movie both fascinated and terrified me. It's one of the few movies that have stuck with me so vividly over the years.<br/><br/>By the time I got to reading the book I was a bit older, and that same sense of wonder had started to wear off. I was too young to enjoy the pseudo-science, and the action in my imagination just didn't live up to my memories of the movie. It was a good book, but ""the movie was better"".<br/><br/>With the 25th anniversary last year, a new audiobook got released, and I was interested to revisit the book. It was a lot better than I remember. I enjoyed the ""science"" better this time around, although the computer related stuff made me go: ""Yeah that's what you get for tampering with such a complex system"" a lot.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since I've seen the movie now, and I plan to revisit it. This seems like one of those rare movies that doesn't tweak too much from the book. It's almost as though Mr. Crichton wrote it to be made into a movie. It wouldn't surprise me to learn that was true.<br/><br/>My favorite Crichton book is [b:Timeline|7669|Timeline|Michael Crichton|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1405420745s/7669.jpg|1525987] (whose movie adaptation is absolutely awful), but this book is probably my second favorite. The way he uses pseudo-science to create thrillers seems unmatched. <br/><br/>This series is arguably his most successful. He takes our childhood fascination with dinosaurs to the next level. He also highlights the arrogance of men. You might think if given the chance, we'd be smarter than the characters in the book, but I'm not sure that'd be true. I fully believe if it were possible to recreate dinosaurs some greedy idiot would totally do it. There is part of me that'd want to visit the park too. Meanwhile the rest of my brain is screaming what a terrible idea it all is.<br/><br/>All and all, this book is a fun ride full of wonder, terror and a lot of stupidity. I'm glad I revisited the book.

I got a free audiobook from Audible thanks to the <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170-the-sword-and-laser"">Sword and Laser</a> podcast and I needed a book for my Christmas road trip, so this seemed like a good fit.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed all the plotting and politics involved in this book. There was also an interesting array of characters with different backgrounds and desires that often lead to confrontation. <br/><br/>This reminds me a lot of Star Trek DS9 or Babylon 5 which I wouldn't be surprised to find were inspired by Dune. Often times the science fiction takes a back seat to the conflict. It's more of a sci-fi setting than a sci-fi story. <br/><br/>It shows that even on another planet with strange creatures and technology that greed, honor, war, revenge and many other Human behaviors are really just the same no matter what the setting.<br/><br/>If I had any one gripe about the book it was lack of detail in the ending. Everything that has building comes to a head and seems to be over in short order. The ending itself wasn't a disappointment, but I felt like the execution was lacking.

When our book club decided to read it this month before the release of the first movie, I was surprised at just how many people hadn't read it before.<br/><br/>This is one of the first fantasy books I ever read, and it's still great as an adult as it was as a child.

All in the span of 300 pages!<br/><br/>He journey from scared Hobbit to brave thief who <spoiler>saves his friends from trouble on more than one occasion, brokers a peace and is present for one of Middle Earth's great battles</spoiler>.<br/><br/>And none of that even mentions his <spoiler>finding of the Ring of Power</spoiler>, which went on to be inspire the basis for one of the greatest fantasy series of all time.<br/><br/>A lot is left to the imagination, which makes this a great book for kids, who imaginations need little prompting to run wild.

He's largely considered to be a horror writer, but I've actually read very little of his horror.<br/><br/>I think most King fans would tell that even in his horror books there is a lot of sci-fi and fantasy. Mr. King is not often one to scare you with the realistic (and least we all hope not).<br/><br/>This book is one of the few I've read that has little to nothing to do with the Dark Tower. The combination of sci-fi and time travel had me intrigued.<br/><br/>On that front I was disappointed. This book at it's core is really just a story about Jake Epping, school teacher from (you guessed it) Maine.<br/><br/>He is recruited by his friend (though really he's seem more like a good acquaintance than a friend) Al, and sent on a mission back in time to stop the Kennedy assassination.<br/><br/>As a child of the 80's, the Kennedy assassination doesn't resonate with me as much as I'm sure it does for those who lived it. The ""watershed moment"", as Mr. King likes to call it, of my life thus far was 9/11.<br/><br/>There is some interesting theorizing about the good (and the bad) of what might have happened had Kennedy lived in this book.<br/><br/>There is an interesting explanation of the Time Travel (though it doesn't come till nearly the very end).<br/><br/>The bulk of this story however, is about a man from 2011 living life in the early 1960s. It has very little to do with Kennedy, time travel or the larger ramifications of changing a watershed moment.<br/><br/>I still enjoyed the book, but it just wasn't what I was expecting.",,,1,,,1,,Audible,Brand new,,

I can't seem to get enough of it. About all I knew coming in was this book had to do with a magic college, and that many people didn't like the protagonist.<br/><br/>I guess I should have read the description. I tend to avoid it though because too many of them seem to provide too much detail about the plot. Really this could be two books. <br/><br/>The first half is totally the magic school trope I was hoping for. The second half is more ""traditional"" fantasy. I would definitely have liked more of the school. More detail about the magic, the school, etc. What there was I enjoyed however.<br/><br/>Then the book took a turn. The protagonist I was kind of indifferent towards, but was far from hating suddenly became extremely unlikable. And so did the plot. It really makes me wonder a bit about Mr. Grossman. Maybe he could use a hug?<br/><br/>Things got REALLY depressing. If I wasn't doing this in audio, I might have put it down. I'm glad I didn't though. Thankfully this sort middle transition period was fairly short and the second half picked up.<br/><br/>The second half feels like an homage to The Chronicles of Narnia. I know I read some of them when I was a kid, but I was never enamored with them the way Quentin is with Fillory.<br/><br/>I found this second half good, though not as much as the first half. Part of that was how generally unlikable Quentin becomes. I still don't really get why Mr. Grossman felt the need to do do that. Some sense or reality? The popularity of dark fantasy?<br/><br/>I don't need everything to be shiny and happy, but it wasn't even like Quinton is someone you love to hate, or some kind of lovable anti-hero. Really he just depressed me a lot. This book could really stand to be a whole hell of a lot less depressing.<br/><br/>There is a great story here, but it gets bogged down in places that will likely turn many people away from it.

It's been on my radar for awhile. I picked up the audiobook over 2 years ago, but never got to it for some reason. I wish I had been around for the group read as I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I found the start a bit slow. It could be bad timing though. I listened to the first quarter or so while traveling. I listened to parts of it standing in line for airport security hoping I wouldn't miss my flight. I listened to other parts wandering around Las Vegas for several hours waiting for my friends to arrive. It may not have had enough of my attention. It's really hard to say.<br/><br/>The other difference might be that instead of being a straight-forward novel, it's really a collection of stories. There is an overarching story of pilgrims on their way to a temple on a planet called Hyperion. However each person has their own backstory to share, and the style of each story tends to vary by quite a lot. I found some stories a lot more interesting than others. <br/><br/>I think my favorite would have to be the Poet's. I find that a bit strange because he was also the character I liked the least. A close second would be the scholar's. That was for entirely different reasons though. Overall I enjoyed all of the stories, but I found the priest's and soldier's the hardest to follow. I should probably go back and relisten as those were the parts I listened to while most distracted.<br/><br/>My only real gripe (if you can really call it that) is this book just sort of stops. I knew coming in it was part of a four book series, but this book could almost be called an extremely long prologue. Most of it is taken up by the backstories of all the characters. All that really means though is I'm jumping right into the next book. If I had to wait for that, I might actually be bothered by it.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this one a lot, and I'm looking forward to finishing the series over the next few months or so.",,,1,,Sword & Laser,1,2013/11/27,Audible,Like new,,

But it could easily be applied to the previous ELEVEN books in the series. I get that this series won't be for everyone, but why have you read 12 books if you just don't think it's that good?

In Bram's case however, I feel like nothing seems to happen.<br/><br/>Some of the Southern characters do make a return around the 70% mark, which was a bit sooner than I hoped/expected but given it's length compared to Feast, I suppose that's about right.<br/><br/>Overall despite a slow point where Mr. Martin chained together a string of chapters with all minor character POVs, I enjoyed this book a lot.<br/><br/>Now I'm stuck waiting like everyone else what will probably be another 5 years or so before seeing the next entry.

It was very tough to read. If I wasn't already invested in the story and the characters from the previous 3 books, I would never have finished.<br/><br/>Most authors I've read seem to grow in their writing ability and style as they go on. <br/><br/>Paolini doesn't appear to have grown at all. I'm not sure if being so successful at such a young age went to his head or if he never went on to get a formal education in writing techniques or what.<br/><br/>His dialogue is just painful in places. I'm not sure if he's trying to dumb things down to a younger reader level or if he just can't write proper dialogue between adults. The book touches on very adult problems of love and loss. Of war and redemption, but the dialogue feels childish in most places.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this book unless like me you want to see how it ends after already reading the previous books. I also wouldn't recommend this series as a whole to a new reader. There is a lot of better fantasy series out there that you should read instead.<br/><br/>Overall the series could have been much shorter. He goes off on tangents at several points in the 3rd and 4th books that don't seem to move the plot forward. This is often an issue with many fantasy books however. <br/><br/>I find it particularly frustrating here because despite all this extra pointless detail, he seems to leave a lot of things unanswered. I hope he doesn't plan to add a 5th book to the series, and that he simply wanted to leave some things to the reader's imagination. I feel like he could have explained a few things better while still accomplishing that however.<br/><br/>Read on if you want some more specific examples of problems with some light spoilers.<br/><br/><spoiler><br/>1. Roran is sent off to win some battle in place of another commander for a city that seems to have real point to the plot apart from growing Roran's reputation and to allow for him to be promoted to a Commander in the army.<br/><br/>2. There is an over abundance of Dues Ex Machina. In particular Angela showing up and solving huge problems at critical moments. Angela's character is never sufficiently explained as to who she is or how she is able to do what she does. She mostly seems to be a plot device Paolini to write himself out of the corners he puts himself in. Another example is some mystery woman who shows up at a critical moment to save Roran from certain death who presence/background is never touched on.<br/><br/>3. The complaint of Paolini's copying from popular works (LotR, Star Wars) is not a new one. I'd forgiven some/most of it as simply popular themes in fiction/fantasy (ie the poor young being thrust into a grand adventure with the mysterious mentor). But his ending is almost identical to the end of LotR. The battle against the great evil won, the heroes move on.<br/><br/></spoiler>",,,,,,1,,,unspecified,,

Rowling|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1362278317s/5.jpg|2402163] because it was better than I remember. This book didn't quite hold up. It's a high 4 though.<br/><br/>Early on I was definite I wanted to drop it 4, but as I got closer to the end I was less sure. I'm still a little iffy on it. This is really a story of two halves. The first half is slow sometimes to the point of being tedious.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if it was intentional or not. I certainly felt as frustrated as the characters at their lack of progress.<br/><br/>The second half of the book is truly excellent. The first part is what spoils a 5 star for me though. I'm trying to be a bit more frugal with what I give 5 stars to, to give that rating a bit more meaning. Cover to Cover this book just wasn't as enjoyable to me as [b:Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|5|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter, #3)|J.K.

My main complaint on my first read still holds true on the reread. I just don't care about the Vord. I enjoy the internal politics of the Alerans. I love the differences of the Alerans to the Marat, Canim and Ice Men. <br/><br/>The battles and interactions with those races seems far superior to the stuff with the Vord. The previous 5 books the Vord while important are more of a setting rather than a large player. A looming threat as it were. In this book unfortunately, they feature way too much for my liking. The scenes where the Vord Queen is talking just felt to go on too long.<br/><br/>That said, I ended up enjoying this book more on my reread than I did the first time. As I said, it's a lot of fun. If you're looking for something deep or complex you'll be disappointed. On the other hand if you want some great characters, a pretty cool magic system, and some really excellent action scenes you'll find plenty of that here.<br/><br/>While Tavi is clearly the main protagonist one could also argue that it's just as much Amara's story as well. It's her POV that opens the series and she plays almost as significant a role in the events of the series as Tavi himself. So it's no surprise that she plays an important role here. <br/><br/>In a genre overrun by male characters, it's a nice change of pace. I can't speak to the accuracy of her as a woman, but she's certainly not your stereotypical female character whose only job is to seduce or annoy the male characters. Some of her stories/scenes got a little slow for me in places, but when they were good I was just as excited to get back to her as I was for Tavi.<br/><br/>Overall I think this is a pretty good conclusion to a pretty good series that will probably always be overshadowed by Mr. Butcher's more popular Dresden Files. Most things are wrapped up pretty well, but I'd love to get a sequel book/series where we catch up to how things play out 20 or 50 years down the road.",,,2+,,,1,,,unspecified,,

However I find myself changing my mind on this reread. Unlike that book all of the subplots in this book greatly interested me. <br/><br/>There was no slowdown in the middle and this might be the only book where anyone’s story was more interesting to me than Tavi’s. I think this series shines best when dealing with internal politics of the Alerans followed closely by the interactions with the Canim. <br/><br/>This series has large amounts of both. We learn a lot more about the Alerans, and see that people can be just as petty towards their fellow man under even the most dire of circumstances.<br/><br/>My least favorite parts have to do with the Vord, but in this book they are still mostly relegated to the setting. In other words they are a looming threat hanging over everything and impacting the interactions between the characters, while not really being on screen all that much.<br/><br/>Tavi still has to rely on his ingenuity more than his personal strength to overcome most obstacles which I think is what makes him such a likable character to me. The interplay between him and Max and Kitai are always my favorite scenes.<br/><br/>Overall a pretty fun book, although compared to [b:Captain's Fury|346087|Captain's Fury (Codex Alera, #4)|Jim Butcher|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1315083292s/346087.jpg|6614434], this ends on a pretty bad cliffhanger such that I jumped right into [b:First Lord's Fury|6316821|First Lord's Fury (Codex Alera, #6)|Jim Butcher|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1327903582s/6316821.jpg|6502096] immediately.",,,2,,,1,,,unspecified,,

Oh and could do magic. Welcome to the White Council.<br/><br/>Donald Morgan is being pursued for the murder of a Senior Council member, and he comes to Harry seeking help. What!?<br/><br/>Yeah, you read that right. The man who spent the better part of two decades trying to find a reason to kill Harry Dresden for being a Warlock is coming to him for help.<br/><br/>The premise of this book is probably one of my favorites. We learn more about the White Council, including getting a look inside their headquarters.<br/><br/>We are also introduced to a brand new baddie, called a Skinwalker, and let's just say it's nasty.<br/><br/>The book is a bit slow in parts, and Morgan is still not a very likable character. He was getting on my nerves as much as he was Harry.<br/><br/>It's also missing many of the best supporting characters that were present in the last book. We do however finally see a return of Billy and the Alphas.

There have been glimmers before, but nothing quite like this.

Mr. Butcher established the world and the key players in the last 2 books, and now he gets down the business of telling the story.<br/><br/><b>Audio book:</b> I didn't like Ms. Reading too much at the start. Her male voices bothered me. By this book however, I couldn't imagine anyone else reading this. There is a scene where random legionaries are calling out and Ms. Reading does different voices for all of them. <br/><br/>I think she's also flushed out the voices she uses for all the main and secondary characters to really add that extra something that not all audio books readers seem to manage.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>I was both a bit eager and nervous for this re-read. This is only of only a handful of books that I've given 5 stars to and on my favorites shelf. My memory of it seems to have held up pretty well however.<br/><br/>This book seems feels far less trope heavy to me as the last two. You still have your chosen one story, but I was just so wrapped up in the awesomeness of it all that I just didn't spend any thinking about it.<br/><br/>The first half of this book is good, but the second half is even better. Unlike the last book where I somewhat dreaded any chapter that took us away from the main story, the secondary stories in this book are much more interesting. Adding a lot of depth to the politics of the world and many of the secondary characters.<br/><br/>For a book that focuses mostly on a newly formed legion, there seems to actually be less time spent on battles, which may be a plus or minus for you depending on how much you enjoy reading them. Personally I think he strikes the balance just right and Tavi really shines in this book as a result.<br/><br/>No one is going to accuse this of being some deep, complex series full of numerous unexpected twists and turns. However while some of it is pretty predictable, I think Mr. Butcher does manage a few surprises amid the more expected plot developments. But honestly, who cares? I was having far too much fun listening this book to spend much of the review getting into that.<br/><br/>Part adventure, part political thriller, part war novel with a decent amount of romance thrown in, there is a likely something for everyone here. I for one had trouble stopping for the day by the end and had to jump right into the next book.",,,2+,,,1,,,unspecified,,

This book starts and ends really well, but slows down in the middle some. <br/><br/>Like the first two books, some of the subplots just move too slow and left me wanting to get back to Tavi's story. In particular Amara's story really dragged for me here. I felt the tedium of her journey a little too much for my liking.<br/><br/>The start of this book mostly picks up right where Cursor's Fury leaves off (albeit a few years have passed) with Tavi and the First Aleran fighting the Canim. <br/><br/>Mr. Butcher does war well, and I think of all the antagonists of the series, the Canim are by far my favorite. They remind me a bit of Klingons. They really fit the proud warrior trope merged with wolfpack mentality to create a fun and interesting race.<br/><br/>The politics are ramped up in this one along with the stakes. Alera is at war on two fronts, and something has to give. The senator and his ""bodyguards"" remind me of everything I hate about politicians, so Mr. Butcher did a good job on that front I think.<br/><br/>The dialogue and the humor are great once again. Mr. Butcher always writes an excellent climax and this one is no different.<br/><br/>While there is still a lot yet to resolve, this one ends in a nice place that allowed me to take a short break and read another book.",,,2+,,,1,,,unspecified,,

Instead it focuses on several of the characters that were more secondary in the first two books.

I still found him kind of annoying and whiny at the start of the series, but in this book he finally starts down the path on his way to my favorite character.

I hope that continues with my reread, because I found her one of the worst parts of the middle books the first time through.<br/><br/>Overall the pace of this book is still pretty good compared to my recollection of later books, and there is a lot of great character development for the supporting cast, in particular Mat.<br/><br/>I'm still going strong for my reread and plan to jump into the 4th book at some point soon.

I was worried that after reading hundreds of fantasy novels, and getting tired of the chosen one trope this book might not hold up to my memory of it. I was happy to find that I had nothing to worry about as I enjoyed it just as much on a reread as I did the first time.<br/><br/><b>Audiobook:</b> One of my main reasons for doing a reread was the chance to do the audio version. Michael Kramer and Kate Reading were already among my favorite narrators. I got to meet them during the [b:A Memory of Light|7743175|A Memory of Light (Wheel of Time, #14)|Robert Jordan|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1336055749s/7743175.jpg|10558806] tour a few years ago, before I really did audiobooks or had any idea of who they were. I regret not spending more time talking to them, or at least getting a picture with them. <br/><br/>Most of this book is narrated by Mr. Kramer, as much of the book is told from Rand or Perrin's perspective. Ms. Reading only does the Nynaeve chapters, and there were very few of those. If I recall correctly from the later books, she'll be getting more to read later on in the series.<br/><br/>Both were excellent as expected.

Sometimes your memory of a thing doesn't hold up on a second inspection. So I was a bit nervous at the idea of rereading it.<br/><br/>You might not know it from looking at my goodreads bookshelf, but I didn't read a lot of fantasy growing up. What little fantasy I read after was mostly Urban Fantasy. I only read Lord of the Rings just before the first movie came out. This was really my first taste of epic fantasy after LotR. <br/><br/>I didn't pick it up until [a:Brandon Sanderson|38550|Brandon Sanderson|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1394044556p2/38550.jpg] was working on the final 3 books. I never had to deal with long waits between books, or deal with the uncertainty following Mr. Jordan's passing. A close friend had recommended me these books in college, but I just never got around to checking them out. I instantly fell in love.<br/><br/>The world Mr. Jordan has created feels huge and well lived in. The passing of ages leaving superstition, rumors and outright misinformation about what really happened. The reader only gets glimpses of the past, and mostly they come from stories. Magic is believed to be a thing of evil, and those who wield it to be feared.<br/><br/>Starting this book again was like catching up with old friends, only not quite as I remember them. My memories of them are how I left them after 13 long books, not the young and wide-eyed youths we meet here. <br/><br/>I forgot how annoying I found Mat in this book. He's incredibly far from my favorite character. Nynaeve wasn't nearly as annoying as she later becomes. I loved meeting Thom, Lan and Moiraine for the first time again. I also discovered there was a lot more foreshadowing in this book than I realized.<br/><br/>Part of my enjoyment could be the nostalgia I feel for this book and the series as a whole. Without it, I might never have discovered how much I love fantasy. I've always been a slow reader, but I was also a much less frequent reader too. It took me the better part of 3 years to read the whole series. <br/><br/>I really love these early books, and the later ones. The character development and world building as the series are fantastic. You get so much from just this one book, and it's really only the tip of the iceberg. <br/><br/>I'm stilling dreading the middle books a bit, but after listening to this book again, there is no way I couldn't at least continue on to [b:The Great Hunt|233649|The Great Hunt (Wheel of Time, #2)|Robert Jordan|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1437870280s/233649.jpg|1574475].

This book has one of the best prologues of the series. Dubbed the ""Darkfriend social"" by fans, we get a ton of foreshadowing and clues to events that don't unfold until later in the series. <br/><br/>Maybe I didn't appreciate it as much the first time as I did on this reread. There are a few slower parts in first half or so, mostly time spent traveling around, but those were never very long or all that slow for me.<br/><br/>I think the real highlight here is we start to broaden the POVs out away from Rand. I like him, and at the core it's really his story, but the reason I love this series is all the depth and subplots. <br/><br/>Nynaeve continues to get on my nerves a bit, but there is part of this book towards then end that reminded me of why she becomes one of my favorite characters later in the series. It's just a shame Mr. Jordan made her so frustrating for so long.<br/><br/>I'm a sucker for the magic school trope, and even though there isn't much of it here, I do like the glimpse we get into the novice program of the Aes Sedai. Egwene, Elayne and Nynaeve all appear to be way more powerful than everyone else, but don't really know what the heck they are doing.<br/><br/>We also get a bit more depth to Mat and Perrin foreshadowing some of their stories to come, that really make this series more than just Rand's tale.<br/><br/>Out in the world we get to meet some great new characters and catch up with some old ones. We learn about traveling stones and alternative universes a bit, adding even more depth to an already epic tale.<br/><br/>Then there are the Seanchan. Just their name makes me mad.

Doing the audiobooks for this series aren't a must like Mr. Butcher's Dresden Files, but they certainly aren't a bad option in my opinion.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>Like the last book, this one started a little slow for me. It also leans heavily on tropes. We get a bit of the magical school trope here, though not a lot of it. For me that's a bad thing, because it's one of the reason I like Harry Potter so much.<br/><br/>Then again when your protagonist has no magical abilities to speak of, I guess it makes little sense to dwell on the magical training that takes place there. Instead most of the focus is on politics between not only the various Aleran factions, but also with the Canim, a fierce wolf-like race who despite being considered enemies of the Alerans, maintain an embassy in the capital. This leads to one of my favorite characters of the series, Ambassador Varg.<br/><br/>This book also introduces my other favorite in Antillar Maximus. His antics remind me a bit of Harry Dresden and add some levity that was mostly lacking from the first novel.<br/><br/>Now what magical school story would be complete without the asshole bully, that I like to call ""The Malfoy""? (I know Harry Potter wasn't the first to use this trope, but its arguably the most popular). Tavi must deal with bullying on a more severe scale than he ever faced back home in the form of Kalarus Brencis Minoris, son of High Lord Kalarus and his two cronies. Is it a requirement the bully have exactly 2 cronies? It certainly seems like it.<br/><br/>The stereotypical bully isn't the only thing of concern here however, and there are once again shades of gray when it comes to just who is ""good"" and who is ""bad"", all rolled up into the politics between nobles that are the most powerful in more than just title. Seriously, you do not want to be trapped in a dark alley with a High Lord or Lady whose pissed at you. It won't end well.<br/><br/>The story is also split with events back in the Calderon valley. I found that subplot a bit slow/uninteresting on this re-read, although Doroga helps to make it worthwhile and the second half of that story is a lot more enjoyable than the first.<br/><br/>Overall I found there is a lot I like here, in particular the politics and some of the new characters, that help me get over some of the slower parts of the story.<br/><br/>On to book 3, which is one of my all-time favorites!",,,2+,,,1,,,unspecified,,

A friend gave me the book that first time and told me I must read it. <br/><br/>It's been many years since that first time, and many re-reads since then, but it was just as enjoyable this time as it was the first.

The start I mean. <br/><br/><i>""The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.""</i><br/><br/>Why? To what purpose? How long has he been chasing him? Ah my friends, these are but a few of many questions.<br/><br/>The journey is the key, and here we throw our lot in with the Gunslinger as he speeds towards his goal. Will we ever reach it? One must continue the journey with Roland to find out. And so I have. Again.<br/><br/>I've lost track of how many times I've read this book. It's probably my least favorite in the series, and yet it contains some of my favorite moments.<br/><br/>The glimpses into Roland's childhood that are a large part of what makes [b:Wizard and Glass|5096|Wizard and Glass (The Dark Tower, #4)|Stephen King|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1327946510s/5096.jpg|750558] one of my absolute favorite books are present in this book with much smaller doses. The story of Roland's coming of age in particular is one I could listen to again and again (and so I have, say thankee-sai).<br/><br/>Another particular favorite of mine is Tull. It gives us a glimpse, and it just a glimpse of who the Gunslinger really is. One of the revisions in the scene I'm not sure I agree with. <spoiler>In the original text Roland shoots Allie without her begging him for it.</spoiler> It's not a ""Han Shot First"" re-write for me, but one I felt un-necessary that tries to offer some forgiveness for Roland's actions.<br/><br/>That said. I love this book. The original book is actually a collection of  5 stories that were published in a magazine over the span of about 3 years. Mr. King revised the book in 2003. <br/><br/>For the most part, the revisions help to fill out the story and clear up some continuity issues that Mr. King hadn't worked out when he first wrote them. You could maybe call it ret-con, but I really consider it more of clarification of detail that was lacking.<br/><br/>I've always wondered why so many people don't like this book. My friend listened to it with his brother. He almost quit the series right there. His brother did. I've seen many people recommend skipping this book outright and coming back to it at the end. I suppose that would work, but the need for it is beyond my comprehension.<br/><br/>I thought maybe this re-read many years since my last around the time of the final 3 books release in the mid 2000s would shed some light on it. It did not.<br/><br/>Maybe it's a sense of nostalgia. Maybe because I first read this book before many of the long sprawling epics I've tackled since. But their are certainly other books I enjoyed as a younger man that I no longer enjoy as an adult.<br/><br/>This book isn't one of those. To me it offers you a glimpse and a promise of all that is to come. For that I must again say Thankee-sai to Mr. King.",,,,,,0,,,,,

I wasn't well-read in fantasy. In late 2006 I discovered [a:Jim Butcher|10746|Jim Butcher|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1205261964p2/10746.jpg] and the Dresden Files. I devoured all the books that were out until I was stuck waiting like everyone else. <br/><br/>Then I noticed in the back of the books that Mr. Butcher had 3 books in another series though, called Codex Alera. Unlike the Dresden Files, it wasn't Urban Fantasy, but closer to ""traditional"" or epic fantasy. I picked it up and devoured those books as well.<br/><br/>For awhile I liked this series better than Dresden Files, but it was a close thing. One thing was for certain, [a:Jim Butcher|10746|Jim Butcher|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1205261964p2/10746.jpg] wrote the kind of books I liked to read. For 3 glorious years I had 2 new Butcher books/year to look forward to.<br/><br/>Fast forward 7 years or so and I recently did a re-read of Dresden Files in audio, but haven't read this one since it ended back in 2009. I'd consider myself much better read in Fantasy than when I first discovered this. <br/><br/>I was a bit apprehensive about a reread. Would the series live up to my memory of it? Or would I find all the tropes tired and boring? The answer is a little of both it seems.<br/><br/>It took me a bit to get back into this book. I was starting to get nervous that I was ruining my memory of this series. However once things really got going, I remembered why I enjoyed it so much.<br/><br/>This is a ""chosen one"" story through and through. However most chosen one stories tend to have a protagonist who is suddenly great at everything. This one does not. In a world where everyone posses at least a little magic, Tavi has none. He is considered a ""freak"". That notion of being an outsider is something I've always identified with. I liked that Tavi had to use his wits to make it in a world where he was always at a disadvantage. That said, a 15 year old shepherd boy who saves the realm has been done. A lot.<br/><br/>The book also has some ""mustache-twirling"" bad guys. Mr. Butcher does a good job at making me hate those characters, but at the same time they feel a bit cartoonish. That said, there are other antagonists in the series who are much more complex. They aren't evil necessarily, but are willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish their goals. Those goals happen to be set against our young protagonist and his family, so they come out looking evil. But are they really? That's an ongoing question that won't be answered here.<br/><br/>I didn't know it until many years later, but Mr. Butcher was challenged to write a story based on a ""lame idea"". He countered that he could it using 2 Lame ideas, that of ""Lost Roman Legion"" and Pokemon. It sounds really stupid, but it somehow works for me.<br/><br/>I know almost nothing of Pokemon apart from the whole capturing magical creatures thing. There may be more to it. I don't know. The strongest furycrafters in the book have the ability to summon powerful elementals ala Pokemon, but they aren't the only part of it. His magic system is really fun and creative, though you really don't get the full experience in just this book. To this day though, it's one of the magic systems I've most enjoyed reading.<br/><br/>So if you can get past the heavy trope use and magic system based on Pokemon, the only other thing that may turn people away is battles. This series is battle heavy. I'd guess most of the last 25% of this book or so is one long battle. I loved it. People that aren't into that kind of thing, may find it tedious.<br/><br/>I think the story is pretty well self-contained. There are a lot of bigger questions looming, but all issues of the book are wrapped up pretty nicely in my opinion.<br/><br/>I had originally planned on alternating the books in this series with books from another, but by the time I got to that battle, there was just no way I could stop. I jumped right into the next book, and may continue on all the way to the end without a break.",,,2+,,,1,,,unspecified,,

I decided after enjoying an audio re-read of Harry Potter and the Dark Tower, that Dresden Files might be a good choice next.<br/><br/>It's really amazing to see how far Jim Butcher has come as a writer, and how far Harry Dresden has evolved as both a character and a Wizard. This book is pretty rough in places. It's the only one I've given 3 stars, most of the rest are 4, and a few are 5s in my book.<br/><br/>There were points in this book I was considering dropping my rating down to a 2. I'm a little surprised I kept on with the series. Then again, back when I found the Dresden Files I hadn't been reading a whole lot, and certainly wasn't as well read in fantasy as I am now.<br/><br/>The idea of Urban Fantasy intrigued me, and I hadn't read anything like it before. Mr. Butcher begins the building blocks of what looks to be an interesting world, with a great set of characters, none better than Harry Himself. <br/><br/>Harry is a wizard. The only one listed in the phone book. He's not very successful and therefore has a lot of money issues. His specialty is finding things. His best source of income is as a consultant for Chicago Police on the strange cases that can't be explained by normal circumstances. <br/><br/>His contact is Lt. Karen Murphy, head of a division of the police tasked with solving the unsolvable and strange cases. Lt. Murphy is a great indicator of the strong female characters Mr. Butcher is able to write.<br/><br/>As this is a noir-style novel, there are some stereotypical female characters, but Lt. Murphy doesn't fit that mold. Tough and determined, she doesn't take crap from anyone, least of all Harry. In your standard story this role would be played by some grizzled old male cop, not a short, young female.<br/><br/>Most of the story is pretty boiler plate. There is a series of strange murders Harry is called in to investigate. Meanwhile he's finally caught a client who wants her to find her husband. Somehow the local mob are involved and everyone is suddenly gunning for Harry.<br/><br/>The best thing going for these early stories is that Mr. Butcher seems to know how to keep things short. He's doesn't fluff the story out. The book finishes pretty strong and left me wanting more, which is usually the best sign of a good book for me.",,,3+,Everyone,,1,,,unspecified,,

And while this book lacks the big revelations of the last book, it makes up for it with an extra dose of fun, as well as adding some layers of complexity to the series.<br/><br/>Books like this are why it's one of my favorite series. 4.5 stars, rounded down because I'm stingy with my 5 star ratings.",,,3,,,1,,,unspecified,,

Probably closer to 3.5 than 4, but since the series is great, I rounded up.<br/><br/>It's the weakest of the 7 books in my opinion.<br/><br/><b>Jim Dale Audio book:</b> I did the Jim Dale audio book first. It was good. Dale is an excellent reader and does a descent job with the voices. I wish I had taken better notes on which voices I liked or didn't to compare with the Fry version a bit.<br/><br/><b>Stephen Fry Audio book:</b> I liked Fry more for this book than I did for the last one. I particularly liked his voices for Dobby and Lockheart. His Snape voice still bothers me, but that's pretty much because I want Alan Rickman's voice.<br/><br/><b>Which Audio book?</b> I've decided I'm no longer going to try to compare Fry to Dale to determine which is better. Why? It really doesn't matter to me. I think they are both a very good, though very different. I find little value it ranking them. People will have their favorites, but just because you like one over the other doesn't mean the same will apply to everyone. Overall I don't think you can go wrong with either version.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>It's a toss up who is more annoying, Dobby the house elf or Professor Lockhart. Neither are unlikable in the way Malfoy and his family are. <br/><br/>I suppose both are supposed to be annoying, but Dobby's scenes are especially tedious. He does redeem himself later in the series however. Moaning Myrtle is a bit annoying as well, but far behind the other 2. <br/><br/>The flying car is a highlight, but that's about it I think. There really aren't any cool additions to the existing lore. It has the weakest antagonist too.<br/><br/>The story has some interesting elements to it, but overall there is just something about this book that has kept it at the bottom of my list on the series. <br/><br/>Maybe it's all the annoying characters, or maybe it's simply a result of the quality of the other books. Still, this like the rest of the series can be a lot of fun is a quick read.",,,6,,,1,,,unspecified,,

Nothing happened. For like 8 hours of audio. A sign of things to come. 3.5 stars rounded up for the much stronger 80%.<br/><br/><b>Audiobook:</b> Another fantastic audio book by Micheal Kramer and Kate Reading. I doubt I could have gotten through the first 20% again if not for doing it in audio.<br/><br/><b><u>Full Review</u></b><br/>My original review from my first read complained about a slow start. It was vastly understating that. My recollection had been this series didn't get slow until the the middle books. I think most of the first 20% could have been thrown away, or trimmed down to just a few chapters.<br/><br/>Once I got past it though, things picked up dramatically. A lot of this book focuses on Perrin. I found him and Faile super annoying in that first 20%, but much better as the story went on. His arc was really good. Eventually. Sensing a theme? I can remember now why he was my favorite of the series for so long though.<br/><br/>My favorite parts on this reread was Mat. I had been waiting for some of these events to happen, thinking they occurred in books 2 or 3. They were even better to experience on a reread because I know what a lot of the cryptic foreshadowing really means. I think I like Mat a lot earlier on in the series than I did originally. He only gets better as the series progresses too.<br/><br/>I was surprised to find myself enjoying Nynaeve so much in this book. I recall finding her very annoying until quite late in the series. However we get a lot of the stuff that I come to love about her later in this book. It's too bad Mr. Jordan had to make her so irritating for so long.<br/><br/>Egywene's story is pretty interesting too, but the best part are the wise ones. For as bad as Mr. Jordan seems to make the Aes Sedai, the Wise Ones are great. I think the Aiel women in general often save this series from itself in terms of the female characters.<br/><br/>Finally of course there is Rand himself. He's got more of a role in this book than the last one, but he still kind of takes a back seat to some of the other characters. I don't feel like we get a good sense about what he's feeling/planning. We're just as in the dark as everyone else.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this book, but that first 20% is really a sign of things to come, and why I went from telling everyone and their brother to read this series, to struggling to get through the middle to when things finally get good again.<br/><br/>I still really like this series, but feel like it could have used a better editing sometimes. I'm looking forward to continuing my audio reread, but I'm dreading some of those slow parts to come.",,,2,,,0,,,,,

Everyone else's however are not as good. <br/><br/>Though to be fair to Mr. Guidall, I'm not sure he's really trying to make them sound like he thinks they would, rather than simply trying to make them sound distinct from one another.<br/><br/>I particularly miss Mr. Mueller's voices for Eddie and Susannah.

After that book, and how long I had to wait for this one, almost anything was going to feel like a letdown.<br/><br/>But this story mixes elements from several things I enjoy. It's like a cross between some of the Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns, and Kurosawa film, which King himself acknowledges as influences to the story at the end of the book.<br/><br/>This book probably more than all the others pulls in pop culture from all over the place, including Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvell Comics and even some of Mr. King's own work ([b:'Salem's Lot|11590|'Salem's Lot|Stephen King|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1327891565s/11590.jpg|3048937]).<br/><br/>In many ways it's another diversion for Roland's Tet from their quest to the beam, but an important one as several developments occur here that make it possible for them them progress further.<br/><br/>As this series is really all about the journey anyways, it's an enjoyable entry that not only gives us more insight into what a Gunslinger did in the time before the world moved on, but it's first real taste of what his Tet can do collectively as Gunslingers themselves.<br/><br/>With this re-read and some time from my original read, I was better able to appreciate what this book has to offer. <br/><br/>It does take a bit of a turn in direction from the previous 4 books that originally left me a bit disappointed, but now I found highly enjoyable, and probably inevitable.<br/><br/>The Dark Tower runs through just about everything Mr. King writes, and he fully embraces that notion with this book, but it really started in [b:Wizard and Glass|5096|Wizard and Glass (The Dark Tower, #4)|Stephen King|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1327946510s/5096.jpg|750558] and Randall Flagg.<br/><br/>I'm eager to finish my journey with Roland, but will be taking a hopefully short break to do 1 or 2 other books before continuing on with [b:Song of Susannah|5093|Song of Susannah (The Dark Tower, #6)|Stephen King|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1347565645s/5093.jpg|1178083].",,,,,,0,,,,,

I think in retrospect it's more due to how great Goblet was (as mentioned above).<br/><br/>The first time I read this I was 20 years old and still in college. I was much closer in age to Harry and his friends.

Rowling|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1361572757s/3.jpg|4640799] on my ordering of the series.<br/><br/>There are several things this book has going for it to redeem all the miserable time of Harry feeling sorry for himself. <br/><br/>First it introduces Luna Lovegood, whose one of my favorite supporting characters.<br/><br/>Second it introduces the DA. This is a place where Harry really comes into his own. It also gives you a reprieve (for the most part) from all of his teenage angst.<br/><br/>Third is just how great Hermoine has become. I've always identified with her more than Harry or Ron. I like order and following the rules. I like books and the learning they can provide. I like being cautious and thinking things out. She's the voice of reason in a book full of teenage angst.<br/><br/>Fourth is the Weasely Twins. They have what could be argued as the best scene in the series in this book. While they are people I probably wouldn't get along with too well (you tell them Hermoine!), they sure go a long way to lighten things up.<br/><br/>And speaking of Weasely's, Ginny really finally comes into her own. She's smart and capable and moved on from fawning over Harry. <br/><br/>The final thing I'll highlight is Dolores Umbridge. This is someone I'm torn on. She is utterly obnoxious and frustrating. However, that is the point of her character, so Ms. Rowling does a fantastic job with her. I think simply coupled with Harry's obnoxious traits, it's just a bit too much for one book. <br/><br/>I also find her to be TOO much of an antagonist, and maybe a lost opportunity. If she was a little more like Fudge and less of a sadist, she could be a truly great villain, though maybe Rowling didn't think the subtlety of inaction would be apparent to her readers?<br/><br/>Overall this book is uneven, and I find how much I like it seems to vary with each reading.",,,5,,,1,,,unspecified,,
